== ACT IV. ==

=== Scene I. The heath. ===

[Enter Edgar.]

Edg.
:Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
:Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
:The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
:Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
:The lamentable change is from the best;
:The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
:Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
:The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
:Owes nothing to thy blasts.—But who comes here?

[Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.]

:My father, poorly led?—World, world, O world!
:But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
:Life would not yield to age.

Old Man.
:O my good lord,
:I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,
:These fourscore years.

Glou.
:Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
:Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
:Thee they may hurt.

Old Man.
:You cannot see your way.

Glou.
:I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
:I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen
:Our means secure us, and our mere defects
:Prove our commodities.—O dear son Edgar,
:The food of thy abused father's wrath!
:Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
:I'd say I had eyes again!

Old Man.
:How now! Who's there?

Edg.
:[Aside.] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?
:I am worse than e'er I was.

Old Man.
:'Tis poor mad Tom.

Edg.
:[Aside.] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not
:So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'

Old Man.
:Fellow, where goest?

Glou.
:Is it a beggar-man?

Old Man.
:Madman and beggar too.

Glou.
:He has some reason, else he could not beg.
:I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
:Which made me think a man a worm: my son
:Came then into my mind, and yet my mind
:Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard more since.
:As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods,—
:They kill us for their sport.

Edg.
:[Aside.] How should this be?—
:Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
:Angering itself and others.—Bless thee, master!

Glou.
:Is that the naked fellow?

Old Man.
:Ay, my lord.

Glou.
:Then pr'ythee get thee gone: if for my sake
:Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
:I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
:And bring some covering for this naked soul,
:Which I'll entreat to lead me.

Old Man.
:Alack, sir, he is mad.

Glou.
:'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.
:Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
:Above the rest, be gone.

Old Man.
:I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
:Come on't what will.

[Exit.]

Glou.
:Sirrah naked fellow,—

Edg.
:Poor Tom's a-cold.
:[Aside.] I cannot daub it further.

Glou.
:Come hither, fellow.

Edg.
:[Aside.] And yet I must.—Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.

Glou.
:Know'st thou the way to Dover?

Edg.
:Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been
:scared out of his good wits:—bless thee, good man's son, from
:the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of
:lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
:stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and
:mowing,—who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,
:bless thee, master!

Glou.
:Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
:Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
:Makes thee the happier;—heavens, deal so still!
:Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
:That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
:Because he does not feel, feel your power quickly;
:So distribution should undo excess,
:And each man have enough.—Dost thou know Dover?

Edg.
:Ay, master.

Glou.
:There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
:Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
:Bring me but to the very brim of it,
:And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
:With something rich about me: from that place
:I shall no leading need.

Edg.
:Give me thy arm:
:Poor Tom shall lead thee.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene II. Before the Duke of Albany's Palace. ===

[Enter Goneril and Edmund; Oswald meeting them.]

Gon.
:Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
:Not met us on the way.—Now, where's your master?

Osw.
:Madam, within; but never man so chang'd.
:I told him of the army that was landed;
:He smil'd at it: I told him you were coming;
:His answer was, 'The worse': Of Gloucester's treachery
:And of the loyal service of his son
:When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot
:And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:—
:What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
:What like, offensive.

Gon.
:[To Edmund.] Then shall you go no further.
:It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
:That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
:Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
:May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
:Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
:I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
:Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
:Shall pass between us; ere long you are like to hear,
:If you dare venture in your own behalf,
:A mistress's command. [Giving a favour.]
:Wear this; spare speech;
:Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
:Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:—
:Conceive, and fare thee well.

Edm.
:Yours in the ranks of death!

[Exit Edmund.]

Gon.
:My most dear Gloucester.
:O, the difference of man and man!
:To thee a woman's services are due:
:My fool usurps my body.

Osw.
:Madam, here comes my lord.

[Exit.]

[Enter Albany.]

Gon.
:I have been worth the whistle.

Alb.
:O Goneril!
:You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
:Blows in your face! I fear your disposition:
:That nature which contemns it origin
:Cannot be bordered certain in itself;
:She that herself will sliver and disbranch
:From her material sap, perforce must wither
:And come to deadly use.

Gon.
:No more; the text is foolish.

Alb.
:Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
:Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
:Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
:A father, and a gracious aged man,
:Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
:Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.
:Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
:A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
:If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
:Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
:It will come,
:Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
:Like monsters of the deep.

Gon.
:Milk-liver'd man!
:That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
:Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
:Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
:Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
:Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
:France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
:With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
:Whiles thou, a moral fool, sitt'st still, and criest
:'Alack, why does he so?'

Alb.
:See thyself, devil!
:Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
:So horrid as in woman.

Gon.
:O vain fool!

Alb.
:Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!
:Be-monster not thy feature! Were't my fitness
:To let these hands obey my blood.
:They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
:Thy flesh and bones:—howe'er thou art a fiend,
:A woman's shape doth shield thee.

Gon.
:Marry, your manhood now!

[Enter a Messenger.]

Alb.
:What news?

Mess.
:O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead;
:Slain by his servant, going to put out
:The other eye of Gloucester.

Alb.
:Gloucester's eyes!

Mess.
:A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
:Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword
:To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,
:Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
:But not without that harmful stroke which since
:Hath pluck'd him after.

Alb.
:This shows you are above,
:You justicers, that these our nether crimes
:So speedily can venge!—But, O poor Gloucester!
:Lost he his other eye?

Mess.
:Both, both, my lord.—
:This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
:'Tis from your sister.

Gon.
:[Aside.] One way I like this well;
:But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
:May all the building in my fancy pluck
:Upon my hateful life: another way
:The news is not so tart.—I'll read, and answer.

[Exit.]

Alb.
:Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

Mess.
:Come with my lady hither.

Alb.
:He is not here.

Mess.
:No, my good lord; I met him back again.

Alb.
:Knows he the wickedness?

Mess.
:Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him;
:And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
:Might have the freer course.

Alb.
:Gloucester, I live
:To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
:And to revenge thine eyes.—Come hither, friend:
:Tell me what more thou know'st.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene III. The French camp near Dover. ===

[Enter Kent and a Gentleman.]

Kent.
:Why the king of France is so suddenly gone back know you the
:reason?

Gent.
:Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming
:forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear
:and danger that his personal return was most required and
:necessary.

Kent.
:Who hath he left behind him general?

Gent.
:The Mareschal of France, Monsieur La Far.

Kent.
:Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?

Gent.
:Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
:And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
:Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
:Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
:Sought to be king o'er her.

Kent.
:O, then it mov'd her.

Gent.
:Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
:Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
:Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
:Were like, a better day: those happy smilets
:That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
:What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence
:As pearls from diamonds dropp'd.—In brief, sorrow
:Would be a rarity most belov'd, if all
:Could so become it.

Kent.
:Made she no verbal question?

Gent.
:Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of 'father'
:Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;
:Cried 'Sisters, sisters!—Shame of ladies! sisters!
:Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
:Let pity not be believ'd!'—There she shook
:The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
:And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
:To deal with grief alone.

Kent.
:It is the stars,
:The stars above us, govern our conditions;
:Else one self mate and mate could not beget
:Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

Gent.
:No.

Kent.
:Was this before the king return'd?

Gent.
:No, since.

Kent.
:Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
:Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
:What we are come about, and by no means
:Will yield to see his daughter.

Gent.
:Why, good sir?

Kent.
:A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
:That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
:To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
:To his dog-hearted daughters,—these things sting
:His mind so venomously that burning shame
:Detains him from Cordelia.

Gent.
:Alack, poor gentleman!

Kent.
:Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?

Gent.
:'Tis so; they are a-foot.

Kent.
:Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear
:And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
:Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
:When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
:Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go
:Along with me.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene IV. The French camp. A Tent. ===

[Enter Cordelia, Physician, and Soldiers.]

Cor.
:Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
:As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
:Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,
:With harlocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
:Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
:In our sustaining corn.—A century send forth;
:Search every acre in the high-grown field,
:And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.]
:What can man's wisdom
:In the restoring his bereaved sense?
:He that helps him take all my outward worth.

Phys.
:There is means, madam:
:Our foster nurse of nature is repose,
:The which he lacks; that to provoke in him
:Are many simples operative, whose power
:Will close the eye of anguish.

Cor.
:All bless'd secrets,
:All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
:Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
:In the good man's distress!—Seek, seek for him;
:Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
:That wants the means to lead it.

[Enter a Messenger.]

Mess.
:News, madam;
:The British powers are marching hitherward.

Cor.
:'Tis known before; our preparation stands
:In expectation of them.—O dear father,
:It is thy business that I go about;
:Therefore great France
:My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
:No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
:But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right:
:Soon may I hear and see him!

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene V. A Room in Gloucester's Castle. ===

[Enter Regan and Oswald.]

Reg.
:But are my brother's powers set forth?

Osw.
:Ay, madam.

Reg.
:Himself in person there?

Osw.
:Madam, with much ado.
:Your sister is the better soldier.

Reg.
:Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

Osw.
:No, madam.

Reg.
:What might import my sister's letter to him?

Osw.
:I know not, lady.

Reg.
:Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
:It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
:To let him live: where he arrives he moves
:All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
:In pity of his misery, to despatch
:His nighted life; moreover, to descry
:The strength o' the enemy.

Osw.
:I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

Reg.
:Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
:The ways are dangerous.

Osw.
:I may not, madam:
:My lady charg'd my duty in this business.

Reg.
:Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
:Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
:Something,—I know not what:—I'll love thee much—
:Let me unseal the letter.

Osw.
:Madam, I had rather,—

Reg.
:I know your lady does not love her husband;
:I am sure of that: and at her late being here
:She gave strange eyeliads and most speaking looks
:To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

Osw.
:I, madam?

Reg.
:I speak in understanding; you are, I know't:
:Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
:My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
:And more convenient is he for my hand
:Than for your lady's.—You may gather more.
:If you do find him, pray you give him this;
:And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
:I pray desire her call her wisdom to her
:So, fare you well.
:If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
:Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

Osw.
:Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
:What party I do follow.

Reg.
:Fare thee well.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene VI. The country near Dover. ===

[Enter Gloucester, and Edgar dressed like a peasant.]

Glou.
:When shall I come to the top of that same hill?

Edg.
:You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.

Glou.
:Methinks the ground is even.

Edg.
:Horrible steep.
:Hark, do you hear the sea?

Glou.
:No, truly.

Edg.
:Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
:By your eyes' anguish.

Glou.
:So may it be indeed:
:Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
:In better phrase and matter than thou didst.

Edg.
:You are much deceiv'd: in nothing am I chang'd
:But in my garments.

Glou.
:Methinks you're better spoken.

Edg.
:Come on, sir; here's the place:—stand still.—How fearful
:And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
:The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
:Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
:Hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade!
:Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
:The fishermen that walk upon the beach
:Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
:Diminish'd to her cock; her cock a buoy
:Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge
:That on the unnumber'd idle pebble chafes
:Cannot be heard so high.—I'll look no more;
:Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
:Topple down headlong.

Glou.
:Set me where you stand.

Edg.
:Give me your hand:—you are now within a foot
:Of th' extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
:Would I not leap upright.

Glou.
:Let go my hand.
:Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
:Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
:Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;
:Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

Edg.
:Now fare ye well, good sir.

[Seems to go.]

Glou.
:With all my heart.

Edg.
:[Aside.] Why I do trifle thus with his despair
:Is done to cure it.

Glou.
:O you mighty gods!
:This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
:Shake patiently my great affliction off:
:If I could bear it longer, and not fall
:To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
:My snuff and loathed part of nature should
:Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!—
:Now, fellow, fare thee well.

Edg.
:Gone, sir:—farewell.—

[Gloucester leaps, and falls along.]

And yet I know not how conceit may rob
:The treasury of life when life itself
:Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
:By this had thought been past.—Alive or dead?
:Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir?—speak!—
:Thus might he pass indeed:—yet he revives.—
:What are you, sir?

Glou.
:Away, and let me die.

Edg.
:Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
:So many fathom down precipitating,
:Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
:Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
:Ten masts at each make not the altitude
:Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
:Thy life is a miracle.—Speak yet again.

Glou.
:But have I fall'n, or no?

Edg.
:From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
:Look up a-height;—the shrill-gorg'd lark so far
:Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.

Glou.
:Alack, I have no eyes.—
:Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
:To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort
:When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
:And frustrate his proud will.

Edg.
:Give me your arm:
:Up:—so.—How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.

Glou.
:Too well, too well.

Edg.
:This is above all strangeness.
:Upon the crown o' the cliff what thing was that
:Which parted from you?

Glou.
:A poor unfortunate beggar.

Edg.
:As I stood here below, methought his eyes
:Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
:Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea:
:It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
:Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
:Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.

Glou.
:I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
:Affliction till it do cry out itself,
:'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
:I took it for a man; often 'twould say,
:'The fiend, the fiend':—he led me to that place.

Edg.
:Bear free and patient thoughts.—But who comes here?

[Enter Lear, fantastically dressed up with flowers.]

The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
:His master thus.

Lear.
:No, they cannot touch me for coining;
:I am the king himself.

Edg.
:O thou side-piercing sight!

Lear.
:Nature 's above art in that respect.—There's your press money.
:That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a
:clothier's yard.—Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace;—this piece
:of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it
:on a giant.—Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!—i'
:the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!—Give the word.

Edg.
:Sweet marjoram.

Lear.
:Pass.

Glou.
:I know that voice.

Lear.
:Ha! Goneril with a white beard!—They flattered me like a dog;
:and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were
:there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said!—'Ay' and 'no',
:too, was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and
:the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at
:my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they
:are not men o' their words: they told me I was everything; 'tis a
:lie—I am not ague-proof.

Glou.
:The trick of that voice I do well remember:
:Is't not the king?

Lear.
:Ay, every inch a king:
:When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
:I pardon that man's life.—What was thy cause?—
:Adultery?—
:Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
:The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
:Does lecher in my sight.
:Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
:Was kinder to his father than my daughters
:Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
:To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.—
:Behold yond simpering dame,
:Whose face between her forks presages snow;
:That minces virtue, and does shake the head
:To hear of pleasure's name;—
:The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
:With a more riotous appetite.
:Down from the waist they are centaurs,
:Though women all above:
:But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
:Beneath is all the fiend's; there's hell, there's darkness,
:There is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench,
:consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!
:Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my
:imagination: there's money for thee.

Glou.
:O, let me kiss that hand!

Lear.
:Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

Glou.
:O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
:Shall so wear out to naught.—Dost thou know me?

Lear.
:I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?
:No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I'll not love.—Read thou this
:challenge; mark but the penning of it.

Glou.
:Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.

Edg.
:I would not take this from report;—it is,
:And my heart breaks at it.

Lear.
:Read.

Glou.
:What, with the case of eyes?

Lear.
:O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money
:in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a
:light: yet you see how this world goes.

Glou.
:I see it feelingly.

Lear.
:What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.
:Look with thine ears: see how yond justice rails upon yond simple
:thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
:is the justice, which is the thief?—Thou hast seen a farmer's
:dog bark at a beggar?

Glou.
:Ay, sir.

Lear.
:And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
:the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.—
:Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
:Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
:Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
:For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
:Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
:Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
:And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
:Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.
:None does offend, none.—I say none; I'll able 'em:
:Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
:To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
:And, like a scurvy politician, seem
:To see the things thou dost not.—Now, now, now, now:
:Pull off my boots: harder, harder:—so.

Edg.
:O, matter and impertinency mix'd!
:Reason, in madness!

Lear.
:If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
:I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
:Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
:Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
:We wawl and cry.—I will preach to thee: mark.

Glou.
:Alack, alack the day!

Lear.
:When we are born, we cry that we are come
:To this great stage of fools—This' a good block:—
:It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
:A troop of horse with felt: I'll put't in proof,;
:And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
:Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

[Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants].

Gent.
:O, here he is: lay hand upon him.—Sir,
:Your most dear daughter,—

Lear.
:No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
:The natural fool of fortune.—Use me well;
:You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
:I am cut to the brains.

Gent.
:You shall have anything.

Lear.
:No seconds? all myself?
:Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
:To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
:Ay, and for laying Autumn's dust.

Gent.
:Good sir,—

Lear.
:I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!
:I will be jovial: come, come, I am a king,
:My masters, know you that.

Gent.
:You are a royal one, and we obey you.

Lear.
:Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it
:by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!

[Exit running. Attendants follow.]

Gent.
:A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
:Past speaking of in a king!—Thou hast one daughter
:Who redeems nature from the general curse
:Which twain have brought her to.

Edg.
:Hail, gentle sir.

Gent.
:Sir, speed you. What's your will?

Edg.
:Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

Gent.
:Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that
:Which can distinguish sound.

Edg.
:But, by your favour,
:How near's the other army?

Gent.
:Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
:Stands on the hourly thought.

Edg.
:I thank you sir: that's all.

Gent.
:Though that the queen on special cause is here,
:Her army is mov'd on.

Edg.
:I thank you, sir.

[Exit Gentleman.]

Glou.
:You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;
:Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
:To die before you please!

Edg.
:Well pray you, father.

Glou.
:Now, good sir, what are you?

Edg.
:A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
:Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
:Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
:I'll lead you to some biding.

Glou.
:Hearty thanks:
:The bounty and the benison of heaven
:To boot, and boot!

[Enter Oswald.]

Osw.
:A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
:That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh
:To raise my fortunes.—Thou old unhappy traitor,
:Briefly thyself remember:—the sword is out
:That must destroy thee.

Glou.
:Now let thy friendly hand
:Put strength enough to it.

[Edgar interposes.]

Osw.
:Wherefore, bold peasant,
:Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
:Lest that the infection of his fortune take
:Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.

Edg.
:Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.

Osw.
:Let go, slave, or thou diest!

Edg.
:Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An chud
:ha' bin zwaggered out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as
:'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near the old man; keep out,
:che vore ye, or ise try whether your costard or my bat be the
:harder: chill be plain with you.

Osw.
:Out, dunghill!

Edg.
:Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins.

[They fight, and Edgar knocks him down.]

Osw.
:Slave, thou hast slain me:—villain, take my purse:
:If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
:And give the letters which thou find'st about me
:To Edmund Earl of Gloucester; seek him out
:Upon the British party: O, untimely death!
:[Dies.]

Edg.
:I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
:As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
:As badness would desire.

Glou.
:What, is he dead?

Edg.
:Sit you down, father; rest you.—
:Let's see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of
:May be my friends.—He's dead; I am only sorry
:He had no other death's-man. Let us see:—
:Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
:To know our enemies' minds, we'd rip their hearts;
:Their papers is more lawful.
:[Reads.] 'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many
:opportunities to cut him off: if your will want not, time and
:place will be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he
:return the conqueror: then am I the prisoner, and his bed my
:gaol; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the
:place for your labour.
:'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant,
:'Goneril.'
:O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!
:A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
:And the exchange my brother!—Here in the sands
:Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
:Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
:With this ungracious paper strike the sight
:Of the death-practis'd duke: for him 'tis well
:That of thy death and business I can tell.

[Exit Edgar, dragging out the body.]

Glou.
:The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
:That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
:Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
:So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
:And woes by wrong imaginations lose
:The knowledge of themselves.

Edg.
:Give me your hand:
:[A drum afar off.]
:Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum:
:Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene VII. A Tent in the French Camp. ===
[Lear on a bed, asleep, soft music playing; Physician, Gentleman, and others attending.]

[Enter Cordelia, and Kent.]

Cor.
:O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
:To match thy goodness? My life will be too short
:And every measure fail me.

Kent.
:To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.
:All my reports go with the modest truth;
:Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.

Cor.
:Be better suited:
:These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
:I pr'ythee, put them off.

Kent.
:Pardon, dear madam;
:Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
:My boon I make it that you know me not
:Till time and I think meet.

Cor.
:Then be't so, my good lord. [To the Physician.] How, does the
:king?

Phys.
:Madam, sleeps still.

Cor.
:O you kind gods,
:Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
:The untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up
:Of this child-changed father!

Phys.
:So please your majesty
:That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.

Cor.
:Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
:I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?

Gent.
:Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep
:We put fresh garments on him.

Phys.
:Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
:I doubt not of his temperance.

Cor.
:Very well.

Phys.
:Please you draw near.—Louder the music there!

Cor.
:O my dear father! Restoration hang
:Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
:Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
:Have in thy reverence made!

Kent.
:Kind and dear princess!

Cor.
:Had you not been their father, these white flakes
:Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face
:To be oppos'd against the warring winds?
:To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
:In the most terrible and nimble stroke
:Of quick cross lightning? to watch—,poor perdu!—
:With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
:Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
:Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
:To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,
:In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
:'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
:Had not concluded all.—He wakes; speak to him.

Doct.
:Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.

Cor.
:How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?

Lear.
:You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:—
:Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
:Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
:Do scald like molten lead.

Cor.
:Sir, do you know me?

Lear.
:You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?

Cor.
:Still, still, far wide!

Phys.
:He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.

Lear.
:Where have I been? Where am I?—Fair daylight,—
:I am mightily abus'd.—I should e'en die with pity,
:To see another thus.—I know not what to say.—
:I will not swear these are my hands:—let's see;
:I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd
:Of my condition!

Cor.
:O, look upon me, sir,
:And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.—
:No, sir, you must not kneel.

Lear.
:Pray, do not mock me:
:I am a very foolish fond old man,
:Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
:And, to deal plainly,
:I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
:Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
:Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant
:What place this is; and all the skill I have
:Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
:Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
:For, as I am a man, I think this lady
:To be my child Cordelia.

Cor.
:And so I am. I am.

Lear.
:Be your tears wet? yes, faith. I pray, weep not:
:If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
:I know you do not love me; for your sisters
:Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
:You have some cause, they have not.

Cor.
:No cause, no cause.

Lear.
:Am I in France?

Kent.
:In your own kingdom, sir.

Lear.
:Do not abuse me.

Phys.
:Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
:You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
:To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
:Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
:Till further settling.

Cor.
:Will't please your highness walk?

Lear.
:You must bear with me:
:Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.

[Exeunt Lear, Cordelia, Physician, and Attendants.]

Gent.
:Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?

Kent.
:Most certain, sir.

Gent.
:Who is conductor of his people?

Kent.
:As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.

Gent.
:They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent
:in Germany.

Kent.
:Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers of
:the kingdom approach apace.

Gent.
:The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
:Fare you well, sir.

[Exit.]

Kent.
:My point and period will be throughly wrought,
:Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

[Exit.]

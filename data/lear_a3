== ACT III. ==

=== Scene I. A Heath. ===

[A storm with thunder and lightning. Enter Kent and a Gentleman,
:meeting.]

Kent.
:Who's there, besides foul weather?

Gent.
:One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

Kent.
:I know you. Where's the king?

Gent.
:Contending with the fretful elements;
:Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
:Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,
:That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
:Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
:Catch in their fury and make nothing of;
:Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
:The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
:This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
:The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
:Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
:And bids what will take all.

Kent.
:But who is with him?

Gent.
:None but the fool, who labours to out-jest
:His heart-struck injuries.

Kent.
:Sir, I do know you;
:And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
:Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
:Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
:With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
:Who have,—as who have not, that their great stars
:Throne and set high?—servants, who seem no less,
:Which are to France the spies and speculations
:Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
:Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes;
:Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
:Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
:Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;—
:But, true it is, from France there comes a power
:Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
:Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
:In some of our best ports, and are at point
:To show their open banner.—Now to you:
:If on my credit you dare build so far
:To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
:Some that will thank you making just report
:Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
:The king hath cause to plain.
:I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
:And from some knowledge and assurance offer
:This office to you.

Gent.
:I will talk further with you.

Kent.
:No, do not.
:For confirmation that I am much more
:Than my out wall, open this purse, and take
:What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,—
:As fear not but you shall,—show her this ring;
:And she will tell you who your fellow is
:That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
:I will go seek the king.

Gent.
:Give me your hand: have you no more to say?

Kent.
:Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet,—
:That, when we have found the king,—in which your pain
:That way, I'll this,—he that first lights on him
:Holla the other.

[Exeunt severally.]

=== Scene II. Another part of the heath. Storm continues. ===

[Enter Lear and Fool.]

Lear.
:Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
:You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
:Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
:You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
:Vaunt couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
:Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
:Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
:Crack nature's moulds, all germens spill at once,
:That make ingrateful man!

Fool.
:O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this
:rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in; and ask thy daughters
:blessing: here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.

Lear.
:Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
:Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters:
:I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
:I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children;
:You owe me no subscription: then let fall
:Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,
:A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man:—
:But yet I call you servile ministers,
:That will with two pernicious daughters join
:Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
:So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!

Fool.
:He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece.
:   The codpiece that will house
:     Before the head has any,
:   The head and he shall louse:
:     So beggars marry many.
:   The man that makes his toe
:     What he his heart should make
:   Shall of a corn cry woe,
:     And turn his sleep to wake.
:—for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
:glass.

Lear.
:No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
:I will say nothing.

[Enter Kent.]


:Kent.
:Who's there?

Fool.
:Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a fool.

Kent.
:Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night
:Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
:Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
:And make them keep their caves; since I was man,
:Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
:Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
:Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
:Th' affliction nor the fear.

Lear.
:Let the great gods,
:That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
:Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
:That hast within thee undivulged crimes
:Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
:Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue
:That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake
:That under covert and convenient seeming
:Hast practis'd on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
:Rive your concealing continents, and cry
:These dreadful summoners grace.—I am a man
:More sinn'd against than sinning.

Kent.
:Alack, bareheaded!
:Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
:Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
:Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house,—
:More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd;
:Which even but now, demanding after you,
:Denied me to come in,—return, and force
:Their scanted courtesy.

Lear.
:My wits begin to turn.—
:Come on, my boy. how dost, my boy? art cold?
:I am cold myself.—Where is this straw, my fellow?
:The art of our necessities is strange,
:That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.—
:Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
:That's sorry yet for thee.

Fool.
:[Singing.]
:   He that has and a little tiny wit—
:     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,—
:   Must make content with his fortunes fit,
:     For the rain it raineth every day.

Lear.
:True, boy.—Come, bring us to this hovel.

[Exeunt Lear and Kent.]

Fool.
:This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.—
:I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:—
:   When priests are more in word than matter;
:   When brewers mar their malt with water;
:   When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
:   No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
:   When every case in law is right;
:   No squire in debt nor no poor knight;
:   When slanders do not live in tongues;
:   Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
:   When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
:   And bawds and whores do churches build;—
:   Then shall the realm of Albion
:   Come to great confusion:
:   Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
:   That going shall be us'd with feet.
:This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

[Exit.]

=== Scene III. A Room in Gloucester's Castle. ===

[Enter Gloucester and Edmund.]

Glou.
:Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing. When I
:desired their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the
:use of mine own house; charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure,
:neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him.

Edm.
:Most savage and unnatural!

Glou.
:Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the dukes,
:and a worse matter than that: I have received a letter this
:night;—'tis dangerous to be spoken;—I have locked the letter in
:my closet: these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
:home; there's part of a power already footed: we must incline to
:the king. I will seek him, and privily relieve him: go you and
:maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him
:perceived: if he ask for me, I am ill, and gone to bed. If I
:die for it, as no less is threatened me, the king my old master
:must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund;
:pray you be careful.

[Exit.]

Edm.
:This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
:Instantly know; and of that letter too:—
:This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
:That which my father loses,—no less than all:
:The younger rises when the old doth fall.

[Exit.]

=== Scene IV. A part of the Heath with a Hovel. Storm continues. ===

[Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.]

Kent.
:Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
:The tyranny of the open night's too rough
:For nature to endure.

Lear.
:Let me alone.

Kent.
:Good my lord, enter here.

Lear.
:Wilt break my heart?

Kent.
:I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.

Lear.
:Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
:Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee
:But where the greater malady is fix'd,
:The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;
:But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
:Thou'dst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the mind's free,
:The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
:Doth from my senses take all feeling else
:Save what beats there.—Filial ingratitude!
:Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
:For lifting food to't?—But I will punish home:—
:No, I will weep no more.—In such a night
:To shut me out!—Pour on; I will endure:—
:In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!—
:Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,—
:O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
:No more of that.

Kent.
:Good my lord, enter here.

Lear.
:Pr'ythee go in thyself; seek thine own ease:
:This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
:On things would hurt me more.—But I'll go in.—
:[To the Fool.] In, boy; go first.—You houseless poverty,—
:Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.—

[Fool goes in.]

:Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
:That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
:How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
:Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
:From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
:Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
:Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
:That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
:And show the heavens more just.

Edg.
:[Within.] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!

[The Fool runs out from the hovel.]

Fool.
:Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit.
:Help me, help me!

Kent.
:Give me thy hand.—Who's there?

Fool.
:A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.

Kent.
:What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
:Come forth.

[Enter Edgar, disguised as a madman.]

Edg.
:Away! the foul fiend follows me!—
:Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.—
:Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

Lear.
:Didst thou give all to thy two daughters?
:And art thou come to this?

Edg.
:Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led
:through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er
:bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
:halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge; made him proud
:of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inched
:bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor.—Bless thy five
:wits!—Tom's a-cold.—O, do de, do de, do de.—Bless thee from
:whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity,
:whom the foul fiend vexes:—there could I have him now,—and
:there,—and there again, and there.
:[Storm continues.]

Lear.
:What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?—
:Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?

Fool.
:Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all shamed.

Lear.
:Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
:Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!

Kent.
:He hath no daughters, sir.

Lear.
:Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
:To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.—
:Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
:Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
:Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
:Those pelican daughters.

Edg.
:Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:—
:Halloo, halloo, loo loo!

Fool.
:This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.

Edg.
:Take heed o' th' foul fiend: obey thy parents; keep thy word
:justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set not
:thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom's a-cold.

Lear.
:What hast thou been?

Edg.
:A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled my hair;
:wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of my mistress' heart, and
:did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake
:words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
:slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it: wine loved
:I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk;
:false of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox
:in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
:Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
:thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot out of brothel, thy hand
:out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the foul
:fiend.—Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind: says
:suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, sessa! let him trot by.

[Storm still continues.]

Lear.
:Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy
:uncovered body this extremity of the skies.—Is man no more than
:this? Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast
:no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume.—Ha! here's three
:on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
:unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
:animal as thou art.—Off, off, you lendings!—Come, unbutton
:here.
:[Tears off his clothes.]

Fool.
:Pr'ythee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night to swim
:in.—Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's
:heart,—a small spark, all the rest on's body cold.—Look, here
:comes a walking fire.

Edg.
:This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew,
:and walks till the first cock; he gives the web and the pin,
:squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat,
:and hurts the poor creature of earth.
:   Swithold footed thrice the old;
:   He met the nightmare, and her nine-fold;
:     Bid her alight
:     And her troth plight,
:   And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

Kent.
:How fares your grace?

[Enter Gloucester with a torch.]

Lear.
:What's he?

Kent.
:Who's there? What is't you seek?

Glou.
:What are you there? Your names?

Edg.
:Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole, the
:wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when the
:foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat
:and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool;
:who is whipped from tithing to tithing, and stocked, punished,
:and imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts
:to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to wear;—
:   But mice and rats, and such small deer,
:   Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
:Beware my follower.—Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!

Glou.
:What, hath your grace no better company?

Edg.
:The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
:Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.

Glou.
:Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile
:That it doth hate what gets it.

Edg.
:Poor Tom's a-cold.

Glou.
:Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
:To obey in all your daughters' hard commands;
:Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
:And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
:Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out
:And bring you where both fire and food is ready.

Lear.
:First let me talk with this philosopher.—
:What is the cause of thunder?

Kent.
:Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.

Lear.
:I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.—
:What is your study?

Edg.
:How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.

Lear.
:Let me ask you one word in private.

Kent.
:Importune him once more to go, my lord;
:His wits begin to unsettle.

Glou.
:Canst thou blame him?
:His daughters seek his death:—ah, that good Kent!—
:He said it would be thus,—poor banish'd man!—
:Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
:I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
:Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life
:But lately, very late: I lov'd him, friend,—
:No father his son dearer: true to tell thee,
:[Storm continues.]
:The grief hath craz'd my wits.—What a night's this!—
:I do beseech your grace,—

Lear.
:O, cry you mercy, sir.—
:Noble philosopher, your company.

Edg.
:Tom's a-cold.

Glou.
:In, fellow, there, into the hovel; keep thee warm.

Lear.
:Come, let's in all.

Kent.
:This way, my lord.

Lear.
:With him;
:I will keep still with my philosopher.

Kent.
:Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.

Glou.
:Take him you on.

Kent.
:Sirrah, come on; go along with us.

Lear.
:Come, good Athenian.

Glou.
:No words, no words: hush.

Edg.
:   Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
:   His word was still—Fie, foh, and fum,
:   I smell the blood of a British man.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene V. A Room in Gloucester's Castle. ===

[Enter Cornwall and Edmund.]

Corn.
:I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

Edm.
:How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to
:loyalty, something fears me to think of.

Corn.
:I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil
:disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit, set
:a-work by a reproveable badness in himself.

Edm.
:How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just! This
:is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent
:party to the advantages of France. O heavens! that this treason
:were not—or not I the detector!

Corn.
:Go with me to the duchess.

Edm.
:If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business
:in hand.

Corn.
:True or false, it hath made thee earl of Gloucester. Seek out
:where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension.

Edm.
:[Aside.] If I find him comforting the king, it will stuff his
:suspicion more fully.—I will persever in my course of loyalty,
:though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.

Corn.
:I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a dearer father
:in my love.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene VI. A Chamber in a Farmhouse adjoining the Castle. ===

[Enter Gloucester, Lear, Kent, Fool, and Edgar.]

Glou.
:Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. I will
:piece out the comfort with what addition I can: I will not be
:long from you.

Kent.
:All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience:—
:the gods reward your kindness!

[Exit Gloucester.]

Edg.
:Frateretto calls me; and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake
:of darkness.—Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

Fool.
:Pr'ythee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a
:yeoman.

Lear.
:A king, a king!

Fool.
:No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he's a mad
:yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.

Lear.
:To have a thousand with red burning spits
:Come hissing in upon 'em,—

Edg.
:The foul fiend bites my back.

Fool.
:He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's health,
:a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

Lear.
:It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.—
:[To Edgar.] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer—
:[To the Fool.] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes!—

Edg.
:Look, where he stands and glares!—Want'st thou eyes at trial,
:madam?
:  Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,—

Fool.
:   Her boat hath a leak,
:   And she must not speak
:   Why she dares not come over to thee.

Edg.
:The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale.
:Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croak not,
:black angel; I have no food for thee.

Kent.
:How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd;
:Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

Lear.
:I'll see their trial first.—Bring in their evidence.
:[To Edgar.] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place;—
:[To the Fool.] And thou, his yokefellow of equity,
:Bench by his side:—[To Kent.] you are o' the commission,
:Sit you too.

Edg.
:   Let us deal justly.
:   Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
:     Thy sheep be in the corn;
:   And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
:     Thy sheep shall take no harm.
:Purr! the cat is gray.

Lear.
:Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my oath before
:this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor king her father.

Fool.
:Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

Lear.
:She cannot deny it.

Fool.
:Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.

Lear.
:And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
:What store her heart is made on.—Stop her there!
:Arms, arms! sword! fire!—Corruption in the place!—
:False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

Edg.
:Bless thy five wits!

Kent.
:O pity!—Sir, where is the patience now
:That you so oft have boasted to retain?

Edg.
:[Aside.] My tears begin to take his part so much
:They'll mar my counterfeiting.

Lear.
:The little dogs and all,
:Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.

Edg.
:Tom will throw his head at them.—Avaunt, you curs!
:   Be thy mouth or black or white,
:   Tooth that poisons if it bite;
:   Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,
:   Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
:   Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,—
:   Tom will make them weep and wail;
:   For, with throwing thus my head,
:   Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
:Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market-
:towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.

Lear.
:Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds about her
:heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
:hearts?—[To Edgar.] You, sir, I entertain you for one of my
:hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments: you'll
:say they are Persian; but let them be changed.

Kent.
:Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

Lear.
:Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
:So, so. We'll go to supper i' the morning.

Fool.
:And I'll go to bed at noon.

[Re-enter Gloucester.]

Glou.
:Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?

Kent.
:Here, sir; but trouble him not,—his wits are gone.

Glou.
:Good friend, I pr'ythee, take him in thy arms;
:I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him;
:There is a litter ready; lay him in't
:And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
:Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master;
:If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
:With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
:Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
:And follow me, that will to some provision
:Give thee quick conduct.

Kent.
:Oppressed nature sleeps:—
:This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken sinews,
:Which, if convenience will not allow,
:Stand in hard cure.—Come, help to bear thy master;
:[To the Fool.] Thou must not stay behind.

Glou.
:Come, come, away!

[Exeunt Kent, Gloucester, and the Fool, bearing off Lear.]

Edg.
:When we our betters see bearing our woes,
:We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
:Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
:Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
:But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip
:When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
:How light and portable my pain seems now,
:When that which makes me bend makes the king bow;
:He childed as I fathered!—Tom, away!
:Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
:When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
:In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
:What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
:Lurk, lurk.

[Exit.]

=== Scene VII. A Room in Gloucester's Castle. ===

[Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Edmund, and Servants.]

Corn.
:Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him this letter:—
:the army of France is landed.—Seek out the traitor Gloucester.

[Exeunt some of the Servants.]

Reg.
:Hang him instantly.

Gon.
:Pluck out his eyes.

Corn.
:Leave him to my displeasure.—Edmund, keep you our sister
:company: the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous
:father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the duke where you
:are going, to a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
:like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.
:Farewell, dear sister:—farewell, my lord of Gloucester.

[Enter Oswald.]

How now! Where's the king?

Osw.
:My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
:Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
:Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
:Who, with some other of the lord's dependants,
:Are gone with him towards Dover: where they boast
:To have well-armed friends.

Corn.
:Get horses for your mistress.

Gon.
:Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

Corn.
:Edmund, farewell.

[Exeunt Goneril, Edmund, and Oswald.]

:Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
:Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.

[Exeunt other Servants.]

:Though well we may not pass upon his life
:Without the form of justice, yet our power
:Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
:May blame, but not control.—Who's there? the traitor?

[Re-enter servants, with Gloucester.]

Reg.
:Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

Corn.
:Bind fast his corky arms.

Glou.
:What mean your graces?—Good my friends, consider
:You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.

Corn.
:Bind him, I say.

[Servants bind him.]

Reg.
:Hard, hard.—O filthy traitor!

Glou.
:Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.

Corn.
:To this chair bind him.—Villain, thou shalt find,—

[Regan plucks his beard.]

Glou.
:By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
:To pluck me by the beard.

Reg.
:So white, and such a traitor!

Glou.
:Naughty lady,
:These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
:Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
:With robber's hands my hospitable favours
:You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?

Corn.
:Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

Reg.
:Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.

Corn.
:And what confederacy have you with the traitors
:Late footed in the kingdom?

Reg.
:To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king?
:Speak.

Glou.
:I have a letter guessingly set down,
:Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
:And not from one oppos'd.

Corn.
:Cunning.

Reg.
:And false.

Corn.
:Where hast thou sent the king?

Glou.
:To Dover.

Reg.
:Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril,—

Corn.
:Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.

Glou.
:I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.

Reg.
:Wherefore to Dover, sir?

Glou.
:Because I would not see thy cruel nails
:Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
:In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
:The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
:In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up,
:And quench'd the stelled fires; yet, poor old heart,
:He holp the heavens to rain.
:If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
:Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'
:All cruels else subscrib'd:—but I shall see
:The winged vengeance overtake such children.

Corn.
:See't shalt thou never.—Fellows, hold the chair.
:Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.

[Gloucester is held down in his chair, while Cornwall plucks out one
:of his eyes and sets his foot on it.]

Glou.
:He that will think to live till he be old,
:Give me some help!—O cruel!—O ye gods!

Reg.
:One side will mock another; the other too!

Corn.
:If you see vengeance,—

First Serv.
:Hold your hand, my lord:
:I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;
:But better service have I never done you
:Than now to bid you hold.

Reg.
:How now, you dog!

First Serv.
:If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
:I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?

Corn.
:My villain!

[Draws, and runs at him.]

First Serv.
:Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.

[Draws. They fight. Cornwall is wounded.]

Reg.
:Give me thy sword [to another servant.]—A peasant stand up thus?

[Snatches a sword, comes behind, and stabs him.]

First Serv.
:O, I am slain!—My lord, you have one eye left
:To see some mischief on thim. O!

[Dies.]

Corn.
:Lest it see more, prevent it.—Out, vile jelly!
:Where is thy lustre now?

[Tears out Gloucester's other eye and throws it on the ground.]

Glou.
:All dark and comfortless.—Where's my son Edmund?
:Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature
:To quit this horrid act.

Reg.
:Out, treacherous villain!
:Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
:That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
:Who is too good to pity thee.

Glou.
:O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.—
:Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!

Reg.
:Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
:His way to Dover.—How is't, my lord? How look you?

Corn.
:I have receiv'd a hurt:—follow me, lady.—
:Turn out that eyeless villain;—throw this slave
:Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace:
:Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.

[Exit Cornwall, led by Regan; Servants unbind Gloucester and lead
:him out.]

Second Serv.
:I'll never care what wickedness I do,
:If this man come to good.

Third Serv.
:If she live long,
:And in the end meet the old course of death,
:Women will all turn monsters.

Second Serv.
:Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
:To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
:Allows itself to anything.

Third Serv.
:Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
:To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!

[Exeunt severally.]

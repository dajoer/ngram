== ACT V. ==

=== Scene I. The Camp of the British Forces near Dover. ===

[Enter, with drum and colours, Edmund, Regan, Officers, Soldiers,
:and others.]

Edm.
:Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
:Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
:To change the course: he's full of alteration
:And self-reproving:—bring his constant pleasure.

[To an Officer, who goes out.]

Reg.
:Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

Edm.
:Tis to be doubted, madam.

Reg.
:Now, sweet lord,
:You know the goodness I intend upon you:
:Tell me,—but truly,—but then speak the truth,
:Do you not love my sister?

Edm.
:In honour'd love.

Reg.
:But have you never found my brother's way
:To the forfended place?

Edm.
:That thought abuses you.

Reg.
:I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
:And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.

Edm.
:No, by mine honour, madam.

Reg.
:I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
:Be not familiar with her.

Edm.
:Fear me not:—
:She and the duke her husband!

[Enter, with drum and colours, Albany, Goneril, and Soldiers.]

Gon.
:[Aside.] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
:Should loosen him and me.

Alb.
:Our very loving sister, well be-met.—
:Sir, this I heard,—the king is come to his daughter,
:With others whom the rigour of our state
:Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
:I never yet was valiant: for this business,
:It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
:Not bolds the king, with others whom, I fear,
:Most just and heavy causes make oppose.

Edm.
:Sir, you speak nobly.

Reg.
:Why is this reason'd?

Gon.
:Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
:For these domestic and particular broils
:Are not the question here.

Alb.
:Let's, then, determine
:With the ancient of war on our proceeding.

Edm.
:I shall attend you presently at your tent.

Reg.
:Sister, you'll go with us?

Gon.
:No.

Reg.
:'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.

Gon.
:[Aside.] O, ho, I know the riddle.—I will go.

[As they are going out, enter Edgar disguised.]

Edg.
:If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
:Hear me one word.

Alb.
:I'll overtake you.—Speak.

[Exeunt Edmund, Regan, Goneril, Officers, Soldiers, and
:Attendants.]

Edg.
:Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
:If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
:For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
:I can produce a champion that will prove
:What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
:Your business of the world hath so an end,
:And machination ceases. Fortune love you!

Alb.
:Stay till I have read the letter.

Edg.
:I was forbid it.
:When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
:And I'll appear again.

Alb.
:Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.

[Exit Edgar.]

[Re-enter Edmund.]

Edm.
:The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
:Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
:By diligent discovery;—but your haste
:Is now urg'd on you.

Alb.
:We will greet the time.

[Exit.]

Edm.
:To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
:Each jealous of the other, as the stung
:Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
:Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
:If both remain alive: to take the widow
:Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
:And hardly shall I carry out my side,
:Her husband being alive. Now, then, we'll use
:His countenance for the battle; which being done,
:Let her who would be rid of him devise
:His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
:Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,—
:The battle done, and they within our power,
:Shall never see his pardon: for my state
:Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

[Exit.]

=== Scene II. A field between the two Camps. ===

[Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours, Lear, Cordelia, and
:their Forces, and exeunt.]

[Enter Edgar and Gloucester.]

Edg.
:Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
:For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
:If ever I return to you again,
:I'll bring you comfort.

Glou.
:Grace go with you, sir!

[Exit Edgar].

[Alarum and retreat within. R-enter Edgar.]

Edg.
:Away, old man,—give me thy hand,—away!
:King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
:Give me thy hand; come on!

Glou.
:No further, sir; a man may rot even here.

Edg.
:What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
:Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
:Ripeness is all:—come on.

Glou.
:And that's true too.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene III. The British Camp near Dover. ===

[Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, Edmund; Lear and
:Cordelia prisoners; Officers, Soldiers, &c.]

Edm.
:Some officers take them away: good guard
:Until their greater pleasures first be known
:That are to censure them.

Cor.
:We are not the first
:Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.
:For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
:Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.—
:Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

Lear.
:No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
:We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
:When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down
:And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
:And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
:At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
:Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,—
:Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;—
:And take upon's the mystery of things,
:As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
:In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones
:That ebb and flow by the moon.

Edm.
:Take them away.

Lear.
:Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
:The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
:He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
:And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
:The goodyears shall devour them, flesh and fell,
:Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve first.
:Come.

[Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded.]

Edm.
:Come hither, captain; hark.
:Take thou this note [giving a paper]; go follow them to prison:
:One step I have advanc'd thee; if thou dost
:As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
:To noble fortunes: know thou this,—that men
:Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
:Does not become a sword:—thy great employment
:Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do't,
:Or thrive by other means.

Capt.
:I'll do't, my lord.

Edm.
:About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
:Mark,—I say, instantly; and carry it so
:As I have set it down.

Capt.
:I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
:If it be man's work, I'll do't.

[Exit.]

[Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Officers, and
:Attendants.]

Alb.
:Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
:And fortune led you well: you have the captives
:Who were the opposites of this day's strife:
:We do require them of you, so to use them
:As we shall find their merits and our safety
:May equally determine.

Edm.
:Sir, I thought it fit
:To send the old and miserable king
:To some retention and appointed guard;
:Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
:To pluck the common bosom on his side,
:And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
:Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
:My reason all the same; and they are ready
:To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
:Where you shall hold your session. At this time
:We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
:And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd
:By those that feel their sharpness:—
:The question of Cordelia and her father
:Requires a fitter place.

Alb.
:Sir, by your patience,
:I hold you but a subject of this war,
:Not as a brother.

Reg.
:That's as we list to grace him.
:Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
:Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
:Bore the commission of my place and person;
:The which immediacy may well stand up
:And call itself your brother.

Gon.
:Not so hot:
:In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
:More than in your addition.

Reg.
:In my rights
:By me invested, he compeers the best.

Gon.
:That were the most if he should husband you.

Reg.
:Jesters do oft prove prophets.

Gon.
:Holla, holla!
:That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.

Reg.
:Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
:From a full-flowing stomach.—General,
:Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
:Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
:Witness the world that I create thee here
:My lord and master.

Gon.
:Mean you to enjoy him?

Alb.
:The let-alone lies not in your good will.

Edm.
:Nor in thine, lord.

Alb.
:Half-blooded fellow, yes.

Reg.
:[To Edmund.] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

Alb.
:Stay yet; hear reason.—Edmund, I arrest thee
:On capital treason; and, in thine arrest,
:This gilded serpent [pointing to Goneril.],—For your claim, fair
:sister,
:I bar it in the interest of my wife;
:'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
:And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
:If you will marry, make your loves to me,—
:My lady is bespoke.

Gon.
:An interlude!

Alb.
:Thou art arm'd, Gloucester:—let the trumpet sound:
:If none appear to prove upon thy person
:Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
:There is my pledge [throwing down a glove]; I'll prove it on thy
:heart,
:Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
:Than I have here proclaim'd thee.

Reg.
:Sick, O, sick!

Gon.
:[Aside.] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

Edm.
:There's my exchange [throwing down a glove]: what in the world he
:is
:That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
:Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
:On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
:My truth and honour firmly.

Alb.
:A herald, ho!

Edm.
:A herald, ho, a herald!

Alb.
:Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
:All levied in my name, have in my name
:Took their discharge.

Reg.
:My sickness grows upon me.

Alb.
:She is not well. Convey her to my tent.

[Exit Regan, led.]

[Enter a Herald.]

Come hither, herald.—Let the trumpet sound,—
:And read out this.

Officer.
:Sound, trumpet!

[A trumpet sounds.]

Her.
:[Reads.] 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists of
:the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,
:that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound
:of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'

Edm.
:Sound!

[First trumpet.]

Her.
:Again!

[Second trumpet.]

Her.
:Again!

[Third trumpet. Trumpet answers within. Enter Edgar, armed,
:preceded by a trumpet.]

Alb.
:Ask him his purposes, why he appears
:Upon this call o' the trumpet.

Her.
:What are you?
:Your name, your quality? and why you answer
:This present summons?

Edg.
:Know, my name is lost;
:By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
:Yet am I noble as the adversary
:I come to cope.

Alb.
:Which is that adversary?

Edg.
:What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

Edm.
:Himself:—what say'st thou to him?

Edg.
:Draw thy sword,
:That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
:Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
:Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
:My oath, and my profession: I protest,—
:Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
:Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
:Thy valour and thy heart,—thou art a traitor;
:False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
:Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;
:And, from the extremest upward of thy head
:To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,
:A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
:This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent
:To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
:Thou liest.

Edm.
:In wisdom I should ask thy name;
:But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
:And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
:What safe and nicely I might well delay
:By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
:Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;
:With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
:Which,—for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,—
:This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
:Where they shall rest for ever.—Trumpets, speak!

[Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls.]

Alb.
:Save him, save him!

Gon.
:This is mere practice, Gloucester:
:By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
:An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
:But cozen'd and beguil'd.

Alb.
:Shut your mouth, dame,
:Or with this paper shall I stop it:—Hold, sir;
:Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:—
:No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it.

[Gives the letter to Edmund.]

Gon.
:Say if I do,—the laws are mine, not thine:
:Who can arraign me for't?

Alb.
:Most monstrous!
:Know'st thou this paper?

Gon.
:Ask me not what I know.

[Exit.]

Alb.
:Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.

[To an Officer, who goes out.]

Edm.
:What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done;
:And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
:'Tis past, and so am I.—But what art thou
:That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
:I do forgive thee.

Edg.
:Let's exchange charity.
:I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
:If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
:My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
:The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
:Make instruments to plague us:
:The dark and vicious place where thee he got
:Cost him his eyes.

Edm.
:Thou hast spoken right; 'tis true;
:The wheel is come full circle; I am here.

Alb.
:Methought thy very gait did prophesy
:A royal nobleness:—I must embrace thee:
:Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
:Did hate thee or thy father!

Edg.
:Worthy prince, I know't.

Alb.
:Where have you hid yourself?
:How have you known the miseries of your father?

Edg.
:By nursing them, my lord.—List a brief tale;—
:And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!—
:The bloody proclamation to escape,
:That follow'd me so near,—O, our lives' sweetness!
:That with the pain of death we'd hourly die
:Rather than die at once!)—taught me to shift
:Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
:That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit
:Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
:Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
:Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;
:Never,—O fault!—reveal'd myself unto him
:Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd;
:Not sure, though hoping of this good success,
:I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
:Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,—
:Alack, too weak the conflict to support!—
:'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
:Burst smilingly.

Edm.
:This speech of yours hath mov'd me,
:And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
:You look as you had something more to say.

Alb.
:If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
:For I am almost ready to dissolve,
:Hearing of this.

Edg.
:This would have seem'd a period
:To such as love not sorrow; but another,
:To amplify too much, would make much more,
:And top extremity.
:Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man
:Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
:Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
:Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms
:He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
:As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
:Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
:That ever ear receiv'd: which in recounting
:His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life
:Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
:And there I left him tranc'd.

Alb.
:But who was this?

Edg.
:Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
:Follow'd his enemy king and did him service
:Improper for a slave.

[Enter a Gentleman hastily, with a bloody knife.]

Gent.
:Help, help! O, help!

Edg.
:What kind of help?

Alb.
:Speak, man.

Edg.
:What means that bloody knife?

Gent.
:'Tis hot, it smokes;
:It came even from the heart of—O! she's dead!

Alb.
:Who dead? speak, man.

Gent.
:Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
:By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.

Edm.
:I was contracted to them both: all three
:Now marry in an instant.

Edg.
:Here comes Kent.

Alb.
:Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:—
:This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble
:Touches us not with pity. [Exit Gentleman.]

[Enter Kent.]

O, is this he?
:The time will not allow the compliment
:That very manners urges.

Kent.
:I am come
:To bid my king and master aye good night:
:Is he not here?

Alb.
:Great thing of us forgot!
:Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?

[The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.]

Seest thou this object, Kent?

Kent.
:Alack, why thus?

Edm.
:Yet Edmund was belov'd.
:The one the other poisoned for my sake,
:And after slew herself.

Alb.
:Even so.—Cover their faces.

Edm.
:I pant for life:—some good I mean to do,
:Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,—
:Be brief in it,—to the castle; for my writ
:Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:—
:Nay, send in time.

Alb.
:Run, run, O, run!

Edg.
:To who, my lord?—Who has the office? send
:Thy token of reprieve.

Edm.
:Well thought on: take my sword,
:Give it the Captain.

Alb.
:Haste thee for thy life.

[Exit Edgar.]

Edm.
:He hath commission from thy wife and me
:To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
:To lay the blame upon her own despair,
:That she fordid herself.

Alb.
:The gods defend her!—Bear him hence awhile.

[Edmund is borne off.]

[Re-enter Lear, with Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar, Officer, and others following.]

Lear.
:Howl, howl, howl, howl!—O, you are men of stone.
:Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
:That heaven's vault should crack.—She's gone for ever!—
:I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
:She's dead as earth.—Lend me a looking glass;
:If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
:Why, then she lives.

Kent.
:Is this the promis'd end?

Edg.
:Or image of that horror?

Alb.
:Fall, and cease!

Lear.
:This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,
:It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
:That ever I have felt.

Kent.
:O my good master! [Kneeling.]

Lear.
:Pr'ythee, away!

Edg.
:'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

Lear.
:A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
:I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!—
:Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
:What is't thou say'st?—Her voice was ever soft,
:Gentle, and low,—an excellent thing in woman.—
:I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

Off.
:'Tis true, my lords, he did.

Lear.
:Did I not, fellow?
:I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
:I would have made them skip: I am old now,
:And these same crosses spoil me.—Who are you?
:Mine eyes are not o' the best:—I'll tell you straight.

Kent.
:If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,
:One of them we behold.

Lear.
:This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

Kent.
:The same,
:Your servant Kent.—Where is your servant Caius?

Lear.
:He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
:He'll strike, and quickly too:—he's dead and rotten.

Kent.
:No, my good lord; I am the very man,—

Lear.
:I'll see that straight.

Kent.
:That from your first of difference and decay
:Have follow'd your sad steps.

Lear.
:You are welcome hither.

Kent.
:Nor no man else:—All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.—
:Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
:And desperately are dead.

Lear.
:Ay, so I think.

Alb.
:He knows not what he says; and vain is it
:That we present us to him.

Edg.
:Very bootless.

[Enter a Officer.]

Off.
:Edmund is dead, my lord.

Alb.
:That's but a trifle here.—
:You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
:What comfort to this great decay may come
:Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,
:During the life of this old majesty,
:To him our absolute power:—[to Edgar and Kent] you to your
:rights;
:With boot, and such addition as your honours
:Have more than merited.—All friends shall taste
:The wages of their virtue, and all foes
:The cup of their deservings.—O, see, see!

Lear.
:And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
:Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
:And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
:Never, never, never, never, never!—
:Pray you undo this button:—thank you, sir.—
:Do you see this? Look on her!—look!—her lips!—
:Look there, look there!—

[He dies.]

Edg.
:He faints!—My lord, my lord!—

Kent.
:Break, heart; I pr'ythee break!

Edg.
:Look up, my lord.

Kent.
:Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him
:That would upon the rack of this rough world
:Stretch him out longer.

Edg.
:He is gone indeed.

Kent.
:The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long:
:He but usurp'd his life.

Alb.
:Bear them from hence.—Our present business
:Is general woe.—[To Kent and Edgar.] Friends of my soul, you
:twain
:Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.

Kent.
:I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
:My master calls me,—I must not say no.

Edg.
:The weight of this sad time we must obey;
:Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
:The oldest have borne most: we that are young
:Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

[Exeunt, with a dead march.]

== ACT II. ==

=== SCENE I. Britain. Before CYMBELINE'S palace.===

[Enter CLOTEN and the two LORDS.]

CLOTEN.
:Was there ever man had such luck! When I kiss'd the jack,
:upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on't; and
:then a whoreson jackanapes must take me up for swearing, as if I
:borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend them at my
:pleasure.

FIRST LORD.
:What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have run all
:out.

CLOTEN.
:When a gentleman is dispos'd to swear, it is not for any
:standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?

SECOND LORD.
:No, my lord;

[Aside.]

nor crop the ears of them.

CLOTEN.
:Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction? Would he had been one of
:my rank!

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

To have smelt like a fool.

CLOTEN.
:I am not vex'd more at anything in the earth; a pox on't! I had
:rather not be so noble as I am.  They dare not fight with me,
:because of the Queen my mother. Every Jack-slave hath his
:bellyful of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock
:that nobody can match.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

You are cock and capon too; and you crow, cock, with your comb
:on.

CLOTEN.
:Sayest thou?

SECOND LORD.
:It is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that
:you give offence to.

CLOTEN.
:No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offence to my
:inferiors.

SECOND LORD.
:Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

CLOTEN.
:Why, so I say.

FIRST LORD.
:Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?

CLOTEN.
:A stranger, and I not known on't!

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.

FIRST LORD.
:There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of Leonatus'
:friends.

CLOTEN.
:Leonatus! a banish'd rascal; and he's another, whatsoever he be. 
:Who told you of this stranger?

FIRST LORD.
:One of your lordship's pages.

CLOTEN.
:Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in't?

SECOND LORD.
:You cannot derogate, my lord.

CLOTEN.
:Not easily, I think.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

You are a fool granted; therefore your issues, being foolish, do
:not derogate.

CLOTEN.
:Come, I'll go see this Italian. What I have lost to-day at bowls
:I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.

SECOND LORD.
:I'll attend your lordship.

[Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD.]

That such a crafty devil as is his mother
:Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
:Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
:Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
:And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
:Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur'st,
:Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
:A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
:More hateful than the foul expulsion is
:Of thy dear husband!  Then that horrid act
:Of the divorce he'd make! The heavens hold firm
:The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshak'd
:That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
:To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!

[Exit.]

=== SCENE II. IMOGEN'S bedchamber in CYMBELINE'S palace ===
[A trunk in one corner of it]

[IMOGEN in bed [reading]; a LADY [attending.]]

IMOGEN.
:Who's there? My woman Helen?

LADY.
:Please you, madam.

IMOGEN.
:What hour is it?

LADY.
:Almost midnight, madam.

IMOGEN.
:I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak.
:Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
:Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
:And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
:I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seiz'd me wholly.

[Exit LADY.]

To your protection I commend me, gods.
:From fairies and the tempters of the night
:Guard me, beseech ye.

[Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk.]

IACHIMO.
:The crickets sing, and man's o'erlabour'd sense
:Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
:Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd
:The chastity he wounded. Cytherea!
:How bravely thou becom'st thy bed, fresh lily,
:And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
:But kiss one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
:How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
:Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o' the taper
:Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids
:To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
:Under these windows white and azure, lac'd
:With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
:To note the chamber. I will write all down:
:Such and such pictures; there the window; such
:The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
:Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.
:Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
:Above ten thousand meaner moveables
:Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
:O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
:And be her sense but as a monument,
:Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off!

[Taking off her bracelet.]

As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
:'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
:As strongly as the conscience does within,
:To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
:A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
:I' the bottom of a cowslip. Here's a voucher,
:Stronger than ever law could make; this secret
:Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
:The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
:Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
:Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
:The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
:Where Philomel gave up. I have enough.
:To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
:Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
:May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
:Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.

[Clock strikes.]

One, two, three; time, time!

[Goes into the trunk.]

=== SCENE III. An ante-chamber adjoining IMOGEN'S apartments. ===

[Enter CLOTEN and LORDS.]

FIRST LORD.
:Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most
:coldest that ever turn'd up ace.

CLOTEN.
:It would make any man cold to lose.

FIRST LORD.
:But not every man patient after the noble temper of your
:lordship. 
:You are most hot and furious when you win.

CLOTEN.
:Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this
:foolish 
:Imogen, I should have gold enough. It's almost morning, is't not?

FIRST LORD.
:Day, my lord.

CLOTEN.
:I would this music would come. I am advised to give her music o' 
:mornings; they say it will penetrate.

[Enter Musicians.]

Come on; tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so;
:we'll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but
:I'll never give o'er. First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;
:after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to it; and
:then let her consider.

SONG

Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
:And Phoebus gins arise
:His steeds to water at those springs
:On chalic'd flowers that lies;
:And winking Mary-buds begin
:To ope their golden eyes;
:With every thing that pretty is,
:My lady sweet, arise,
:Arise, arise.

So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music
:the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears, which
:horse-hairs and calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch
:to boot, can never amend.

[Exeunt Musicians.]

[Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN.]

SECOND LORD.
:Here comes the King.

CLOTEN.
:I am glad I was up so late, for that's the reason I was up so
:early.
:He cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.
:—Good morrow to your Majesty and to my gracious mother!

CYMBELINE.
:Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
:Will she not forth?

CLOTEN.
:I have assail'd her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice.

CYMBELINE.
:The exile of her minion is too new;
:She hath not yet forgot him.  Some more time
:Must wear the print of his remembrance on't,
:And then she's yours.

QUEEN.
:You are most bound to the King,
:Who lets go by no vantages that may
:Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
:To orderly soliciting, and be friended
:With aptness of the season; make denials
:Increase your services; so seem as if
:You were inspir'd to do those duties which
:You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
:Save when command to your dismission tends,
:And therein you are senseless.

CLOTEN.
:Senseless? Not so.

[Enter a MESSENGER.]

MESSENGER.
:So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
:The one is Caius Lucius.

CYMBELINE.
:A worthy fellow,
:Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
:But that's no fault of his. We must receive him
:According to the honour of his sender;
:And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
:We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
:When you have given good morning to your mistress,
:Attend the Queen and us; we shall have need
:To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.

[Exeunt all but CLOTEN.]

CLOTEN.
:If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
:Let her lie still and dream. By your leave, ho!

[Knocks.]

I know her women are about her; what
:If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
:Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes
:Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
:Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold
:Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief,
:Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What
:Can it not do and undo? I will make
:One of her women lawyer to me, for
:I yet not understand the case myself.
:By your leave.

[Knocks.]

[Enter a LADY.]

LADY.
:Who's there that knocks?

CLOTEN.
:A gentleman.

LADY.
:No more?

CLOTEN.
:Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.

LADY.
:That's more
:Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
:Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?

CLOTEN.
:Your lady's person.  Is she ready?

LADY.
:Ay,
:To keep her chamber.

CLOTEN.
:There is gold for you; sell me your good report.

LADY.
:How! my good name? Or to report of you
:What I shall think is good?—The Princess!

[Enter IMOGEN.]

CLOTEN.
:Good morrow, fairest.  Sister, your sweet hand.

[Exit LADY.]

IMOGEN.
:Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
:For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
:Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,
:And scarce can spare them.

CLOTEN.
:Still, I swear I love you.

IMOGEN.
:If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me.
:If you swear still, your recompense is still
:That I regard it not.

CLOTEN.
:This is no answer.

IMOGEN.
:But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
:I would not speak. I pray you, spare me. Faith,
:I shall unfold equal discourtesy
:To your best kindness.  One of your great knowing
:Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

CLOTEN.
:To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin. I will not.

IMOGEN.
:Fools are not mad folks.

CLOTEN.
:Do you call me fool?

IMOGEN.
:As I am mad, I do.
:If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
:That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
:You put me to forget a lady's manners,
:By being so verbal; and learn now, for all,
:That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
:By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
:And am so near the lack of charity
:To accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather
:You felt than make't my boast.

CLOTEN.
:You sin against
:Obedience, which you owe your father. For
:The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
:One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
:With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none;
:And though it be allowed in meaner parties—
:Yet who than he more mean?—to knit their souls—
:On whom there is no more dependency
:But brats and beggary,—in self-figur'd knot,
:Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
:The consequence o' the crown, and must not foil
:The precious note of it with a base slave,
:A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
:A pantler, not so eminent!

IMOGEN.
:Profane fellow!
:Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
:But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
:To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,
:Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
:Comparative for your virtues, to be styl'd
:The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
:For being preferr'd so well.

CLOTEN.
:The south-fog rot him!

IMOGEN.
:He never can meet more mischance than come
:To be but nam'd of thee. His mean'st garment
:That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
:In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
:Were they all made such men. How now?

[Missing the bracelet.]

Pisanio!

[Enter PISANIO.]

CLOTEN.
:"His garments!"  Now the devil—

IMOGEN.
:To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently—

CLOTEN.
:"His garment!"

IMOGEN.
:I am sprited with a fool,
:Frighted, and ang'red worse. Go bid my woman
:Search for a jewel that too casually
:Hath left mine arm. It was thy master's.  Shrew me,
:If I would lose it for a revenue
:Of any king's in Europe.  I do think
:I saw't this morning; confident I am
:Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it.
:I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
:That I kiss aught but he.

PISANIO.
:'Twill not be lost.

IMOGEN.
:I hope so; go and search.

[Exit PISANIO.]

CLOTEN.
:You have abus'd me
:"His meanest garment!"

IMOGEN.
:Ay, I said so, sir.
:If you will make't an action, call witness to't.

CLOTEN.
:I will inform your father.

IMOGEN.
:Your mother too.
:She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
:But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
:To the worst of discontent.

[Exit.]

CLOTEN.
:I'll be reveng'd.
:"His meanest garment!"  Well.

[Exit.]

=== SCENE IV. Rome. PHILARIO'S house. ===

[Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Fear it not, sir; I would I were so sure
:To win the King as I am bold her honour
:Will remain hers.

PHILARIO.
:What means do you make to him?

POSTHUMUS.
:Not any, but abide the change of time,
:Quake in the present winter's state, and wish
:That warmer days would come. In these fear'd hopes,
:I barely gratify your love; they failing,
:I must die much your debtor.

PHILARIO.
:Your very goodness and your company
:O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
:Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius
:Will do's commission throughly; and I think
:He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
:Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
:Is yet fresh in their grief.

POSTHUMUS.
:I do believe,
:Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
:That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
:The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
:In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
:Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
:Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
:Smil'd at their lack of skill, but found their courage
:Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline,
:Now wing-led with their courages, will make known
:To their approvers they are people such
:That mend upon the world.

[Enter IACHIMO.]

PHILARIO.
:See! Iachimo!

POSTHUMUS.
:The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
:And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
:To make your vessel nimble.

PHILARIO.
:Welcome, sir.

POSTHUMUS.
:I hope the briefness of your answer made
:The speediness of your return.

IACHIMO.
:Your lady
:Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.

POSTHUMUS.
:And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
:Look through a casement to allure false hearts
:And be false with them.

IACHIMO.
:Here are letters for you.

POSTHUMUS.
:Their tenour good, I trust.

IACHIMO.
:'Tis very like.

PHILARIO.
:Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
:When you were there?

IACHIMO.
:He was expected then,
:But not approach'd.

POSTHUMUS.
:All is well yet.
:Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is't not
:Too dull for your good wearing?

IACHIMO.
:If I have lost it,
:I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
:I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
:A second night of such sweet shortness which
:Was mine in Britain; for the ring is won.

POSTHUMUS.
:The stone's too hard to come by.

IACHIMO.
:Not a whit,
:Your lady being so easy.

POSTHUMUS.
:Make not, sir,
:Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we
:Must not continue friends.

IACHIMO.
:Good sir, we must,
:If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
:The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
:We were to question farther; but I now
:Profess myself the winner of her honour,
:Together with your ring; and not the wronger
:Of her or you, having proceeded but
:By both your wills.

POSTHUMUS.
:If you can make't apparent
:That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
:And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
:You had of her pure honour gains or loses
:Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
:To who shall find them.

IACHIMO.
:Sir, my circumstances,
:Being so near the truth as I will make them,
:Must first induce you to believe; whose strength
:I will confirm with oath, which, I doubt not,
:You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
:You need it not.

POSTHUMUS.
:Proceed.

IACHIMO.
:First, her bedchamber,—
:Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
:Had that was well worth watching—it was hang'd
:With tapestry of silk and silver; the story
:Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
:And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
:The press of boats or pride; a piece of work
:So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
:In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
:Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
:Since the true life on't was—

POSTHUMUS.
:This is true;
:And this you might have heard of here, by me,
:Or by some other.

IACHIMO.
:More particulars
:Must justify my knowledge.

POSTHUMUS.
:So they must,
:Or do your honour injury.

IACHIMO.
:The chimney
:Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
:Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures
:So likely to report themselves. The cutter
:Was as another Nature, dumb; outwent her,
:Motion and breath left out.

POSTHUMUS.
:This is a thing
:Which you might from relation likewise reap,
:Being, as it is, much spoke of.

IACHIMO.
:The roof o' the chamber
:With golden cherubins is fretted.  Her andirons—
:I had forgot them—were two winking Cupids
:Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
:Depending on their brands.

POSTHUMUS.
:This is her honour!
:Let it be granted you have seen all this—and praise
:Be given to your remembrance—the description
:Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
:The wager you have laid.

IACHIMO.
:Then, if you can,

[Showing the bracelet.]

Be pale. I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
:And now 'tis up again. It must be married
:To that your diamond; I'll keep them.

POSTHUMUS.
:Jove!
:Once more let me behold it. Is it that
:Which I left with her?

IACHIMO.
:Sir—I thank her—that.
:She stripp'd it from her arm.  I see her yet.
:Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
:And yet enrich'd it too. She gave it me, and said
:She priz'd it once.

POSTHUMUS.
:May be she pluck'd it off
:To send it me.

IACHIMO.
:She writes so to you, doth she?

POSTHUMUS.
:O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;

[Gives the ring.]

It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
:Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
:Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love
:Where there's another man. The vows of women
:Of no more bondage, be to where they are made,
:Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
:O, above measure false!

PHILARIO.
:Have patience, sir,
:And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.
:It may be probable she lost it, or
:Who knows if one her women, being corrupted,
:Hath stolen it from her?

POSTHUMUS.
:Very true;
:And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring.
:Render to me some corporal sign about her,
:More evident than this; for this was stolen.

IACHIMO.
:By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.

POSTHUMUS.
:Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
:'Tis true—nay, keep the ring—'tis true. I am sure
:She would not lose it. Her attendants are
:All sworn and honourable.  They induced to steal it!
:And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.
:The cognizance of her incontinency
:Is this.  She hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
:There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
:Divide themselves between you!

PHILARIO.
:Sir, be patient.
:This is not strong enough to be believ'd
:Of one persuaded well of—

POSTHUMUS.
:Never talk on't;
:She hath been colted by him.

IACHIMO.
:If you seek
:For further satisfying, under her breast—
:Worthy the pressing—lies a mole, right proud
:Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
:I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
:To feed again, though full. You do remember
:This stain upon her?

POSTHUMUS.
:Ay, and it doth confirm
:Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
:Were there no more but it.

IACHIMO.
:Will you hear more?

POSTHUMUS.
:Spare your arithmetic; never count the turns;
:Once, and a million!

IACHIMO.
:I'll be sworn—

POSTHUMUS.
:No swearing.
:If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
:And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
:Thou'st made me cuckold.

IACHIMO.
:I'll deny nothing.

POSTHUMUS.
:O, that I had her here, to tear her limbmeal!
:I will go there and do't, i' the court, before
:Her father. I'll do something—

[Exit.]

PHILARIO.
:Quite besides
:The government of patience! You have won.
:Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
:He hath against himself.

IACHIMO.
:With all my heart.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE V. Another room in PHILARIO'S house. ===

[Enter POSTHUMUS.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Is there no way for men to be, but women
:Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;
:And that most venerable man which I
:Did call my father, was I know not where
:When I was stamp'd. Some coiner with his tools
:Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem'd
:The Dian of that time. So doth my wife
:The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
:Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
:And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
:A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
:Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
:As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!
:This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,—was't not?—
:Or less,—at first?—perchance he spoke not, but,
:Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
:Cried "O!" and mounted; found no opposition
:But what he look'd for should oppose and she
:Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
:The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
:That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
:It is the woman's part; be it lying, note it,
:The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
:Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
:Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
:Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
:All faults that may be nam'd, nay, that hell knows,
:Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all.
:For even to vice
:They are not constant, but are changing still
:One vice, but of a minute old, for one
:Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
:Detest them, curse them; yet 'tis greater skill
:In a true hate, to pray they have their will.
:The very devils cannot plague them better.

[Exit.]

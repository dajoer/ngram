== ACT V== 

=== SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp. ===

[Enter POSTHUMUS [with a bloody handkerchief.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd
:Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
:If each of you should take this course, how many
:Must murder wives much better than themselves
:For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
:Every good servant does not all commands;
:No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
:Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
:Had liv'd to put on this; so had you saved
:The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
:Me, wretch, more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
:You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
:To have them fall no more:  you some permit
:To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
:And make them dread it, to the doer's thrift.
:But Imogen is your own; do your best wills,
:And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
:Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
:Against my lady's kingdom. 'Tis enough
:That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
:I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
:Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
:Of these Italian weeds, and suit myself
:As does a Briton peasant; so I'll fight
:Against the part I come with; so I'll die
:For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
:Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
:Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
:Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
:More valour in me than my habits show.
:Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
:To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
:The fashion, less without and more within.

[Exit.]

=== SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps. ===

[Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman Army at one door; and the Briton army at another; LEONATUS POSTHUMUS following, like a poor soldier. They march over and go out. Alarums.  Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO, and POSTHUMUS:  he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him.]

IACHIMO.
:The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
:Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,
:The Princess of this country, and the air on't
:Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
:A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
:In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne
:As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
:If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
:This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
:Is that we scarce are men, and you are gods.

[Exit.]

[The battle continues; the BRITONS fly; CYMBELINE is taken:
:then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.]

BELARIUS.
:Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;
:The lane is guarded.  Nothing routs us but
:The villainy of our fears.

GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS.
:Stand, stand, and fight!

[Re-enter POSTHUMUS, and seconds the Britons.  They rescue
:CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO,
:and IMOGEN.]

LUCIUS.
:Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
:For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
:As war were hoodwink'd.

IACHIMO.
:'Tis their fresh supplies.

LUCIUS.
:It is a day turn'd strangely. Or betimes
:Let's reinforce, or fly.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE III. Another part of the field. ===

[Enter POSTHUMUS and a Briton LORD.]

LORD.
:Cam'st thou from where they made the stand?

POSTHUMUS.
:I did;
:Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.

LORD.
:I did.

POSTHUMUS.
:No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost,
:But that the heavens fought; the King himself
:Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
:And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying,
:Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted,
:Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring, having work
:More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
:Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
:Merely through fear, that the straight pass was damm'd
:With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
:To die with length'ned shame.

LORD.
:Where was this lane?

POSTHUMUS.
:Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;
:Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
:An honest one, I warrant; who deserv'd
:So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
:In doing this for's country. Athwart the lane,
:He, with two striplings—lads more like to run
:The country base than to commit such slaughter;
:With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
:Than those for preservation cas'd, or shame,—
:Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
:"Our Britain's harts die flying, not our men.
:To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand!
:Or we are Romans and will give you that
:Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save
:But to look back in frown. Stand, stand!" These three,
:Three thousand confident, in act as many—
:For three performers are the file when all
:The rest do nothing—with this word "Stand, stand!"
:Accommodated by the place, more charming
:With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
:A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks.
:Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some, turn'd coward
:But by example—O, a sin in war,
:Damn'd in the first beginners!—gan to look
:The way that they did, and to grin like lions
:Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
:A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
:A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly
:Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
:The strides they victors made:  and now our cowards,
:Like fragments in hard voyages, became
:The life o' the need. Having found the back-door open
:Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
:Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
:O'erborne i' the former wave; ten, chas'd by one,
:Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty.
:Those that would die or ere resist are grown
:The mortal bugs o' the field.

LORD.
:This was strange chance.
:A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys!

POSTHUMUS.
:Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made
:Rather to wonder at the things you hear
:Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
:And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
:"Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
:Preserv'd the Britons, was the Romans' bane."

LORD.
:Nay, be not angry, sir.

POSTHUMUS.
:'Lack, to what end?
:Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
:For if he'll do as he is made to do,
:I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
:You have put me into rhyme.

LORD.
:Farewell; you're angry.

[Exit.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Still going? This is a lord! O noble misery,
:To be i' the field and ask "what news?" of me!
:To-day how many would have given their honours
:To have sav'd their carcasses! took heel to do't,
:And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
:Could not find Death where I did hear him groan,
:Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,
:'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
:Sweet words; or hath moe ministers than we
:That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him;
:For being now a favourer to the Briton,
:No more a Briton, I have resum'd again
:The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
:But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
:Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
:Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
:Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death.
:On either side I come to spend my breath;
:Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
:But end it by some means for Imogen.

[Enter two [BRITISH] CAPTAINS and soldiers.]

FIRST CAPTAIN.
:Great Jupiter be prais'd! Lucius is taken.
:'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.

SECOND CAPTAIN.
:There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
:That gave the affront with them.

FIRST CAPTAIN.
:So 'tis reported;
:But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?

POSTHUMUS.
:A Roman,
:Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
:Had answer'd him.

SECOND CAPTAIN.
:Lay hands on him; a dog!
:A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
:What crows have peck'd them here. He brags his service,
:As if he were of note. Bring him to the King.

[Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,
:PISANIO, [SOLDIERS, ATTENDANTS] and Roman captives. 
:The CAPTAINS present POSTHUMUS to CYMBELINE, who 
:delivers him over to a Gaoler.  [Then exeunt omnes.]

=== SCENE IV. A British prison. ===

[Enter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS.]

FIRST GAOLER.
:You shall not now be stolen, you have locks upon you;
:So graze as you find pasture.

SECOND GAOLER.
:Ay, or a stomach.

[Exeunt GAOLERS.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Most welcome bondage! for thou art a way,
:I think, to liberty; yet am I better
:Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather
:Groan so in perpetuity than be cur'd
:By the sure physician, Death, who is the key
:To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
:More than my shanks and wrists.  You good gods, give me
:The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
:Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
:So children temporal fathers do appease;
:Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,
:I cannot do it better than in gyves,
:Desir'd more than constrain'd:  to satisfy,
:If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
:No stricter render of me than my all.
:I know you are more clement than vile men,
:Who of their broken debtors take a third,
:A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
:On their abatement.  That's not my desire.
:For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
:'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
:'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
:Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake;
:You rather mine, being yours; and so, great powers,
:If you will take this audit, take this life,
:And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
:I'll speak to thee in silence.

[Sleeps.]

[Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS
:LEONATUS, father to POSTHUMUS, an old man, attired
:like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron, his wife, 
:and mother to POSTHUMUS, with music before them. Then, 
:after other music, follow the two young LEONATI, brothers 
:to POSTHUMUS, with wounds as they died in the wars. They 
:circle POSTHUMUS round, as he lies sleeping.]

SICILIUS.
:No more, thou thunder-master, show
:Thy spite on mortal flies:
:With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
:That thy adulteries
:Rates and revenges.
:Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
:Whose face I never saw?
:I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
:Attending Nature's law;
:Whose father then, as men report
:Thou orphans' father art,
:Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
:From this earth-vexing smart.

MOTHER.
:Lucina lent not me her aid,
:But took me in my throes,
:That from me was Posthumus ript,
:Came crying 'mongst his foes,
:A thing of pity!

SICILIUS.
:Great Nature, like his ancestry,
:Moulded the stuff so fair,
:That he deserv'd the praise o' the world,
:As great Sicilius' heir.

FIRST BROTHER.
:When once he was mature for man,
:In Britain where was he
:That could stand up his parallel,
:Or fruitful object be
:In eye of Imogen, that best
:Could deem his dignity?

MOTHER.
:With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
:To be exil'd, and thrown
:From Leonati seat, and cast
:From her his dearest one,
:Sweet Imogen?

SICILIUS.
:Why did you suffer Iachimo,
:Slight thing of Italy,
:To taint his nobler heart and brain
:With needless jealousy;
:And to become the geck and scorn
:O' the other's villainy?

SECOND BROTHER.
:For this from stiller seats we came,
:Our parents and us twain,
:That striking in our country's cause
:Fell bravely and were slain,
:Our fealty and Tenantius' right
:With honour to maintain.

FIRST BROTHER.
:Like hardiment Posthumus hath
:To Cymbeline perform'd.
:Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
:Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
:The graces for his merits due,
:Being all to dolours turn'd?

SICILIUS.
:Thy crystal window ope; look out;
:No longer exercise
:Upon a valiant race thy harsh
:And potent injuries.

MOTHER.
:Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
:Take off his miseries.

SICILIUS.
:Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
:Or we poor ghosts will cry
:To the shining synod of the rest
:Against thy deity.

BOTH BROTHERS.
:Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,
:And from thy justice fly.

[JUPITER descends in thunder and lightning, sitting
:upon an eagle; he throws a thunderbolt. The GHOSTS
:fall on their knees.]

JUPITER.
:No more, you petty spirits of region low,
:Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
:Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
:Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
:Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
:Upon your never-withering banks of flowers.
:Be not with mortal accidents opprest:
:No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
:Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
:The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
:Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift.
:His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
:Our jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
:Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
:He shall be lord of Lady Imogen,
:And happier much by his affliction made.
:This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
:Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine.
:And so, away!  No farther with your din
:Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
:Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.

[Ascends.]

SICILIUS.
:He came in thunder; his celestial breath
:Was sulphurous to smell.  The holy eagle
:Stoop'd, as to foot us. His ascension is
:More sweet than our blest fields. His royal bird
:Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
:As when his god is pleas'd.

ALL.
:Thanks, Jupiter!

SICILIUS.
:The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
:His radiant roof. Away! and, to be blest,
:Let us with care perform his great behest.

[The GHOSTS] vanish.]

POSTHUMUS.

[Waking.]

Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
:A father to me, and thou hast created
:A mother and two brothers; but, O scorn!
:Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born.
:And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
:On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
:Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve.
:Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
:And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,
:That have this golden chance and know not why.
:What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
:Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
:Nobler than that it covers! Let thy effects
:So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
:As good as promise!

[Reads.]

"Whenas a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without 
:seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of tender air; and 
:when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches, which,
:being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
:stock and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,
:Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty."

'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
:Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing,
:Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
:As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
:The action of my life is like it, which
:I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

[Re-enter GAOLER.]

GAOLER.
:Come, sir, are you ready for death?

POSTHUMUS.
:Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.

GAOLER.
:Hanging is the word, sir  If you be ready for that, you are
:well cook'd.

POSTHUMUS.
:So, if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish
:pays the shot.

GAOLER.
:A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you shall 
:be called to no more payments, fear no more tavern-bills,
:which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of
:mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with
:too much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that
:you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the
:heavier for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of
:heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the
:charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You
:have no true debitor and creditor but it; of what's past, is, and
:to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters;
:so the acquittance follows.

POSTHUMUS.
:I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

GAOLER.
:Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache; but a man
:that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I
:think he would change places with his officer; for, look you, sir,
:you know not which way you shall go.

POSTHUMUS.
:Yes, indeed do I, fellow.

GAOLER.
:Your Death has eyes in's head, then; I have not seen him so
:pictur'd. You must either be directed by some that take upon them
:to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not
:know, or jump the after inquiry on your own peril. And how you
:shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll never return to
:tell one.

POSTHUMUS.
:I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the
:way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.

GAOLER.
:What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best
:use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging's the
:way of winking.

[Enter a MESSENGER.]

MESSENGER.
:Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the King.

POSTHUMUS.
:Thou bring'st good news; I am call'd to be made free.

GAOLER.
:I'll be hang'd then.

POSTHUMUS.
:Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.

[Exeunt all but the GAOLER.]

GAOLER.
:Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets, I 
:never saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, there are verier
:knaves desire to live, for all he be a Roman; and there be some
:of them too that die against their wills.  So should I, if I were
:one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, there
:were desolation of gaolers and gallowses! I speak against my
:present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in't.

[Exit.]

=== SCENE V. CYMBELINE'S tent. ===

[Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO,
:LORDS, [OFFICERS, and Attendants.]

CYMBELINE.
:Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
:Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
:That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
:Whose rags sham'd gilded arms, whose naked breast
:Stepp'd before targes of proof, cannot be found.
:He shall be happy that can find him, if
:Our grace can make him so.

BELARIUS.
:I never saw
:Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
:Such precious deeds in one that promis'd nought
:But beggary and poor looks.

CYMBELINE.
:No tidings of him?

PISANIO.
:He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
:But no trace of him.

CYMBELINE.
:To my grief, I am
:The heir of his reward;

[To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.]

which I will add
:To you, the liver, heart, and brain of Britain,
:By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
:To ask of whence you are. Report it.

BELARIUS.
:Sir,
:In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen.
:Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
:Unless I add, we are honest.

CYMBELINE.
:Bow your knees.
:Arise my knights o' the battle.  I create you
:Companions to our person and will fit you
:With dignities becoming your estates.

[Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES.]

There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
:Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,
:And not o' the court of Britain.

CORNELIUS.
:Hail, great King!
:To sour your happiness, I must report
:The Queen is dead.

CYMBELINE.
:Who worse than a physician
:Would this report become? But I consider
:By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
:Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?

CORNELIUS.
:With horror, madly dying, like her life,
:Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
:Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
:I will report, so please you.  These her women
:Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
:Were present when she finish'd.

CYMBELINE.
:Prithee, say.

CORNELIUS.
:First, she confess'd she never lov'd you; only
:Affected greatness got by you, not you;
:Married your royalty, was wife to your place,
:Abhorr'd your person.

CYMBELINE.
:She alone knew this;
:And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
:Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.

CORNELIUS.
:Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
:With such integrity, she did confess
:Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
:But that her flight prevented it, she had
:Ta'en off by poison.

CYMBELINE.
:O most delicate fiend!
:Who is't can read a woman? Is there more?

CORNELIUS.
:More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
:For you a mortal mineral, which, being took,
:Should by the minute feed on life, and ling'ring
:By inches waste you; in which time she purpos'd,
:By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
:O'ercome you with her show, and, in time,
:When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
:Her son into the adoption of the crown;
:But, failing of her end by his strange absence,
:Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
:Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
:The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
:Despairing died.

CYMBELINE.
:Heard you all this, her women?

LADY.
:We did, so please your Highness.

CYMBELINE.
:Mine eyes
:Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
:Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
:That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious
:To have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter!
:That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
:And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

[Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, [the SOOTHSAYER] and other
:Roman prisoners [guarded]; POSTHUMUS behind, and IMOGEN.]

Thou com'st not, Caius, now for tribute; that
:The Britons have raz'd out, though with the loss
:Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit
:That their good souls may be appeas'd with slaughter
:Of you their captives, which ourself have granted.
:So think of your estate.

LUCIUS.
:Consider, sir, the chance of war. The day
:Was yours by accident.  Had it gone with us,
:We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten'd
:Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
:Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
:May be call'd ransom, let it come. Sufficeth
:A Roman, with a Roman's heart can suffer.
:Augustus lives to think on't; and so much
:For my peculiar care. This one thing only
:I will entreat:  my boy, a Briton born,
:Let him be ransom'd. Never master had
:A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
:So tender over his occasions, true,
:So feat, so nurse-like.  Let his virtue join
:With my request, which I'll make bold your Highness
:Cannot deny.  He hath done no Briton harm,
:Though he have serv'd a Roman. Save him, sir,
:And spare no blood beside.

CYMBELINE.
:I have surely seen him;
:His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
:Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
:And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
:To say "Live, boy."  Ne'er thank thy master; live,
:And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
:Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it,
:Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
:The noblest ta'en.

IMOGEN.
:I humbly thank your Highness.

LUCIUS.
:I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
:And yet I know thou wilt.

IMOGEN.
:No, no, alack,
:There's other work in hand. I see a thing
:Bitter to me as death; your life, good master,
:Must shuffle for itself.

LUCIUS.
:The boy disdains me,
:He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys
:That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
:Why stands he so perplex'd?

CYMBELINE.
:What wouldst thou, boy?
:I love thee more and more; think more and more
:What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? Speak,
:Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?

IMOGEN.
:He is a Roman, no more kin to me
:Than I to your Highness; who, being born your vassal,
:Am something nearer.

CYMBELINE.
:Wherefore ey'st him so?

IMOGEN.
:I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
:To give me hearing.

CYMBELINE.
:Ay, with all my heart,
:And lend my best attention. What's thy name?

IMOGEN.
:Fidele, sir.

CYMBELINE.
:Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
:I'll be thy master. Walk with me; speak freely.

[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN talk apart.]

BELARIUS.
:Is not this boy, reviv'd from death,—

ARVIRAGUS.
:One sand another
:Not more resembles,—that sweet rosy lad
:Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?

GUIDERIUS.
:The same dead thing alive.

BELARIUS.
:Peace, peace! see further. He eyes us not; forbear;
:Creatures may be alike.  Were't he, I am sure
:He would have spoke to us.

GUIDERIUS.
:But we saw him dead.

BELARIUS.
:Be silent; let's see further.

PISANIO.

[Aside.]

It is my mistress.
:Since she is living, let the time run on
:To good or bad.

[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward.]

CYMBELINE.
:Come, stand thou by our side;
:Make thy demand aloud.

[To IACHIMO.]

Sir, step you forth;
:Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;
:Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
:Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
:Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.

IMOGEN.
:My boon is, that this gentleman may render
:Of whom he had this ring.

POSTHUMUS.

[Aside.]

What's that to him?

CYMBELINE.
:That diamond upon your finger, say
:How came it yours?

IACHIMO.
:Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
:Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.

CYMBELINE.
:How! me?

IACHIMO.
:I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
:Which torments me to conceal. By villainy
:I got this ring. 'Twas Leonatus' jewel,
:Whom thou didst banish; and—which more may grieve thee,
:As it doth me—a nobler sir ne'er liv'd
:'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

CYMBELINE.
:All that belongs to this.

IACHIMO.
:That paragon, thy daughter,—
:For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
:Quail to remember,—Give me leave; I faint.

CYMBELINE.
:My daughter! What of her? Renew thy strength.
:I had rather thou shouldst live while Nature will
:Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.

IACHIMO.
:Upon a time,—unhappy was the clock
:That struck the hour!—it was in Rome,—accurs'd
:The mansion where!—'twas at a feast,—O, would
:Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
:Those which I heav'd to head!—the good Posthumus—
:What should I say? He was too good to be
:Where ill men were; and was the best of all
:Amongst the rar'st of good ones,—sitting sadly,
:Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
:For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
:Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
:The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva,
:Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
:A shop of all the qualities that man
:Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
:Fairness which strikes the eye—

CYMBELINE.
:I stand on fire:
:Come to the matter.

IACHIMO.
:All too soon I shall,
:Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
:Most like a noble lord in love and one
:That had a royal lover, took his hint;
:And not dispraising whom we prais'd,—therein
:He was as calm as virtue,—he began
:His mistress' picture; which by his tongue being made,
:And then a mind put in't, either our brags
:Were crack'd of kitchen trulls, or his description
:Prov'd us unspeaking sots.

CYMBELINE.
:Nay, nay, to th' purpose.

IACHIMO.
:Your daughter's chastity—there it begins.
:He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
:And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
:Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
:Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
:Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
:In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
:By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
:No lesser of her honour confident
:Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
:And would so, had it been a carbuncle
:Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
:Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
:Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,
:Remember me at court, where I was taught
:Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
:'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
:Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
:Gan in your duller Britain operate
:Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent;
:And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd,
:That I return'd with similar proof enough
:To make the noble Leonatus mad,
:By wounding his belief in her renown
:With tokens thus, and thus; averring notes
:Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,—
:O cunning, how I got it!—nay, some marks
:Of secret on her person, that he could not
:But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
:I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon—
:Methinks, I see him now—

POSTHUMUS.

[Advancing.]

Ay, so thou dost,
:Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
:Egregious murderer, thief, anything
:That's due to all the villains past, in being,
:To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
:Some upright justicer! Thou, King, send out
:For torturers ingenious; it is I
:That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
:By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
:That kill'd thy daughter:—villain-like, I lie—
:That caused a lesser villain than myself,
:A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
:Of Virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
:Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
:The dogs o' the street to bay me; every villain
:Be call'd Posthumus Leonatus; and
:Be villainy less than 'twas! O Imogen
:My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
:Imogen, Imogen!

IMOGEN.
:Peace, my lord; hear, hear—

POSTHUMUS.
:Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
:There lies thy part.

[Striking her; she falls.]

PISANIO.
:O gentlemen, help
:Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
:You ne'er kill'd Imogen till now. Help, help!
:Mine honour'd lady!

CYMBELINE.
:Does the world go round?

POSTHUMUS.
:How comes these staggers on me?

PISANIO.
:Wake, my mistress!

CYMBELINE.
:If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
:To death with mortal joy.

PISANIO.
:How fares my mistress?

IMOGEN.
:O, get thee from my sight;
:Thou gav'st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence!
:Breathe not where princes are.

CYMBELINE.
:The tune of Imogen!

PISANIO.
:Lady,
:The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
:That box I gave you was not thought by me
:A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.

CYMBELINE.
:New matter still?

IMOGEN.
:It poison'd me.

CORNELIUS.
:O gods!
:I left out one thing which the Queen confess'd,
:Which must approve thee honest. "If Pisanio
:Have," said she "given his mistress that confection
:Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv'd
:As I would serve a rat."

CYMBELINE.
:What's this, Cornelius?

CORNELIUS.
:The Queen, sir, very oft importun'd me
:To temper poisons for her, still pretending
:The satisfaction of her knowledge only
:In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
:Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose
:Was of more danger, did compound for her
:A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
:The present power of life, but in short time
:All offices of nature should again
:Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?

IMOGEN.
:Most like I did, for I was dead.

BELARIUS.
:My boys,
:There was our error.

GUIDERIUS.
:This is, sure, Fidele.

IMOGEN.
:Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
:Think that you are upon a rock, and now
:Throw me again.

[Embracing him.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Hang there like fruit, my soul,
:Till the tree die!

CYMBELINE.
:How now, my flesh, my child!
:What, mak'st thou me a dullard in this act?
:Wilt thou not speak to me?

IMOGEN.

[Kneeling.]

Your blessing, sir.

BELARIUS.

[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS.]

Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not;
:You had a motive for't.

CYMBELINE.
:My tears that fall
:Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
:Thy mother's dead.

IMOGEN.
:I am sorry for't, my lord.

CYMBELINE.
:O, she was naught; and long of her it was
:That we meet here so strangely; but her son
:Is gone, we know not how nor where.

PISANIO.
:My lord,
:Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
:Upon my lady's missing, came to me
:With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
:If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
:It was my instant death. By accident,
:I had a feigned letter of my master's
:Then in my pocket, which directed him
:To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
:Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
:Which he enforc'd from me, away he posts
:With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate
:My lady's honour. What became of him
:I further know not.

GUIDERIUS.
:Let me end the story:
:I slew him there.

CYMBELINE.
:Marry, the gods forfend!
:I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
:Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,
:Deny't again.

GUIDERIUS.
:I have spoke it, and I did it.

CYMBELINE.
:He was a prince.

GUIDERIUS.
:A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
:Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
:With language that would make me spurn the sea,
:If it could so roar to me. I cut off's head;
:And am right glad he is not standing here
:To tell this tale of mine.

CYMBELINE.
:I am sorry for thee.
:By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
:Endure our law. Thou'rt dead.

IMOGEN.
:That headless man
:I thought had been my lord.

CYMBELINE.
:Bind the offender,
:And take him from our presence.

BELARIUS.
:Stay, sir King;
:This man is better than the man he slew,
:As well descended as thyself; and hath
:More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
:Had ever scar for.

[To the Guard.]

Let his arms alone;
:They were not born for bondage.

CYMBELINE.
:Why, old soldier,
:Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
:By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
:As good as we?

ARVIRAGUS.
:In that he spake too far.

CYMBELINE.
:And thou shalt die for't.

BELARIUS.
:We will die all three
:But I will prove that two on's are as good
:As I have given out him. My sons, I must
:For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,
:Though, haply, well for you.

ARVIRAGUS.
:Your danger's ours.

GUIDERIUS.
:And our good his.

BELARIUS.
:Have at it then, by leave.
:Thou hadst, great King, a subject who
:Was call'd Belarius.

CYMBELINE.
:What of him? He is
:A banish'd traitor.

BELARIUS.
:He it is that hath
:Assum'd this age, indeed a banish'd man;
:I know not how a traitor.

CYMBELINE.
:Take him hence,
:The whole world shall not save him.

BELARIUS.
:Not too hot.
:First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
:And let it be confiscate all so soon
:As I have receiv'd it.

CYMBELINE.
:Nursing of my sons!

BELARIUS.
:I am too blunt and saucy; here's my knee.
:Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
:Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
:These two young gentlemen, that call me father,
:And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
:They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
:And blood of your begetting.

CYMBELINE.
:How! my issue!

BELARIUS.
:So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
:Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd.
:Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
:Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
:Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes—
:For such and so they are—these twenty years
:Have I train'd up.  Those arts they have as
:Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
:Your Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
:Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children.
:Upon my banishment I mov'd her to't,
:Having receiv'd the punishment before,
:For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty
:Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,
:The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shap'd
:Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
:Here are your sons again; and I must lose
:Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
:The benediction of these covering heavens
:Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
:To inlay heaven with stars.

CYMBELINE.
:Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
:The service that you three have done is more
:Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children;
:If these be they, I know not how to wish
:A pair of worthier sons.

BELARIUS.
:Be pleas'd awhile.
:This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
:Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;
:This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
:Your younger princely son.  He, sir, was lapp'd
:In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
:Of his queen mother, which for more probation
:I can with ease produce.

CYMBELINE.
:Guiderius had
:Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
:It was a mark of wonder.

BELARIUS.
:This is he,
:Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
:It was wise Nature's end in the donation,
:To be his evidence now.

CYMBELINE.
:O, what, am I
:A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
:Rejoic'd deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
:That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
:You may reign in them now! O Imogen,
:Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

IMOGEN.
:No, my lord;
:I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
:Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
:But I am truest speaker. You call'd me brother,
:When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
:When ye were so indeed.

CYMBELINE.
:Did you e'er meet?

ARVIRAGUS.
:Ay, my good lord.

GUIDERIUS.
:And at first meeting lov'd;
:Continu'd so, until we thought he died.

CORNELIUS.
:By the Queen's dram she swallow'd.

CYMBELINE.
:O rare instinct!
:When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment
:Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
:Distinction should be rich in. Where, how liv'd you?
:And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
:How parted with your brothers? How first met them?
:Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
:And your three motives to the battle, with
:I know not how much more, should be demanded;
:And all the other by-dependencies,
:From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place
:Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
:Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
:And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
:On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting
:Each object with a joy; the counterchange
:Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
:And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.

[To BELARIUS.]

Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.

IMOGEN.
:You are my father too, and did relieve me,
:To see this gracious season.

CYMBELINE.
:All o'erjoy'd,
:Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,
:For they shall taste our comfort.

IMOGEN.
:My good master,
:I will yet do you service.

LUCIUS.
:Happy be you!

CYMBELINE.
:The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
:He would have well becom'd this place, and grac'd
:The thankings of a king.

POSTHUMUS.
:I am, sir,
:The soldier that did company these three
:In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
:The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
:Speak, Iachimo. I had you down and might
:Have made you finish.

IACHIMO.

[Kneeling.]

I am down again;
:But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
:As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
:Which I so often owe; but your ring first,
:And here the bracelet of the truest princess
:That ever swore her faith.

POSTHUMUS.
:Kneel not to me.
:The power that I have on you is to spare you,
:The malice towards you to forgive you. Live,
:And deal with others better.

CYMBELINE.
:Nobly doom'd!
:We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
:Pardon's the word to all.

ARVIRAGUS.
:You holp us, sir,
:As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
:Joy'd are we that you are.

POSTHUMUS.
:Your servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,
:Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought
:Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
:Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
:Of mine own kindred. When I wak'd, I found
:This label on my bosom; whose containing
:Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
:Make no collection of it. Let him show
:His skill in the construction.

LUCIUS.
:Philarmonus!

SOOTHSAYER.
:Here, my good lord.

LUCIUS.
:Read, and declare the meaning.

SOOTHSAYER.

[Reads.]

"Whenas a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown, without 
:seeking find, and be embrac'd by a piece of tender air; and 
:when from a stately cedar shall be lopp'd branches, which, 
:being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the 
:old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his 
:miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty."
:Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
:The fit and apt construction of thy name,
:Being leo-natus, doth import so much.

[To CYMBELINE.]

The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
:Which we call mollis aer; and mollis aer
:We term it mulier; which mulier I divine
:Is this most constant wife, who, even now
:Answering the letter of the oracle,
:Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
:With this most tender air.

CYMBELINE.
:This hath some seeming.

SOOTHSAYER.
:The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
:Personates thee; and thy lopp'd branches point
:Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stolen,
:For many years thought dead, are now reviv'd,
:To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
:Promises Britain peace and plenty.

CYMBELINE.
:Well;
:My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
:Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
:And to the Roman empire, promising
:To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
:We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
:Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
:Have laid most heavy hand.

SOOTHSAYER.
:The fingers of the powers above do tune
:The harmony of this peace. The vision
:Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
:Of yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant
:Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
:From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
:Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
:So vanish'd; which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
:The imperial Caesar, should again unite
:His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
:Which shines here in the west.

CYMBELINE.
:Laud we the gods;
:And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
:From our bless'd altars. Publish we this peace
:To all our subjects. Set we forward.  Let
:A Roman and a British ensign wave
:Friendly together. So through Lud's town march;
:And in the temple of great Jupiter
:Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
:Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
:Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.

[Exeunt.]

== ACT V. ==

=== SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle. ===

[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.]

DOCTOR.
:I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no
:truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

GENTLEWOMAN.
:Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her
:rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her
:closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon it, read it,
:afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this
:while in a most fast sleep.

DOCTOR.
:A great perturbation in nature,—to receive at once the
:benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching— In this
:slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual
:performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?

GENTLEWOMAN.
:That, sir, which I will not report after her.

DOCTOR.
:You may to me; and 'tis most meet you should.

GENTLEWOMAN.
:Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to confirm my
:speech. Lo you, here she comes! 

[Enter Lady Macbeth, with a taper.]

:This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe
:her; stand close.

DOCTOR.
:How came she by that light?

GENTLEWOMAN.
:Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; 'tis her
:command.

DOCTOR.
:You see, her eyes are open.

GENTLEWOMAN.
:Ay, but their sense is shut.

DOCTOR.
:What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.

GENTLEWOMAN.
:It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her
:hands: I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.

LADY MACBETH.
:Yet here's a spot.

DOCTOR.
:Hark, she speaks: I will set down what comes from her, to
:satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

LADY MACBETH.
:Out, damned spot! out, I say!— One; two; why, then 'tis
:time to do't ;—Hell is murky!—Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier,
:and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call
:our power to account?—Yet who would have thought the old man to
:have had so much blood in him?

DOCTOR.
:Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH.
:The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now?—What,
:will these hands ne'er be clean? No more o' that, my lord, no
:more o' that: you mar all with this starting.

DOCTOR.
:Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

GENTLEWOMAN.
:She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that:
:heaven knows what she has known.

LADY MACBETH.
:Here's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
:of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!

DOCTOR.
:What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

GENTLEWOMAN.
:I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
:dignity of the whole body.

DOCTOR.
:Well, well, well,—

GENTLEWOMAN.
:Pray God it be, sir.

DOCTOR.
:This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those
:which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in
:their beds.

LADY MACBETH.
:Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
:pale:—I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he cannot come
:out on's grave.

DOCTOR.
:Even so?

LADY MACBETH.
:To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate: come, come, come,
:come, give me your hand: what's done cannot be undone: to bed, to
:bed, to bed.

[Exit.]

DOCTOR.
:Will she go now to bed?

GENTLEWOMAN.
:Directly.

DOCTOR.
:Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
:Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
:To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
:More needs she the divine than the physician.—
:God, God, forgive us all!—Look after her;
:Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
:And still keep eyes upon her:—so, good-night:
:My mind she has mated, and amaz'd my sight:
:I think, but dare not speak.

GENTLEWOMAN.
:Good-night, good doctor.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane. ===

[Drum and colours. Enter Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, and Soldiers.]

MENTEITH.
:The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
:His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
:Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
:Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
:Excite the mortified man.

ANGUS.
:Near Birnam wood
:Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

CAITHNESS.
:Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

LENNOX.
:For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
:Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son
:And many unrough youths, that even now
:Protest their first of manhood.

MENTEITH.
:What does the tyrant?

CAITHNESS.
:Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
:Some say he's mad; others, that lesser hate him,
:Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
:He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
:Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS.
:Now does he feel
:His secret murders sticking on his hands;
:Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
:Those he commands move only in command,
:Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
:Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
:Upon a dwarfish thief.

MENTEITH.
:Who, then, shall blame
:His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
:When all that is within him does condemn
:Itself for being there?

CAITHNESS.
:Well, march we on,
:To give obedience where 'tis truly ow'd:
:Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal;
:And with him pour we, in our country's purge,
:Each drop of us.

LENNOX.
:Or so much as it needs,
:To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.
:Make we our march towards Birnam.

[Exeunt, marching.]

=== SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle. ===

[Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.]

MACBETH.
:Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
:Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane
:I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
:Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
:All mortal consequences have pronounc'd me thus,—
:"Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
:Shall e'er have power upon thee."—Then fly, false thanes,
:And mingle with the English epicures:
:The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,
:Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

[Enter a Servant.]

:The devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac'd loon!
:Where gott'st thou that goose look?

SERVANT.
:There is ten thousand—

MACBETH.
:Geese, villain?

SERVANT.
:Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH.
:Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,
:Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
:Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
:Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

SERVANT.
:The English force, so please you.

MACBETH.
:Take thy face hence.

[Exit Servant.]

:Seyton!—I am sick at heart,
:When I behold—Seyton, I say!- This push
:Will chair me ever or disseat me now.
:I have liv'd long enough: my way of life
:Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
:And that which should accompany old age,
:As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
:I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
:Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
:Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
:Seyton!—

[Enter Seyton.]

SEYTON.
:What's your gracious pleasure?

MACBETH.
:What news more?

SEYTON.
:All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.

MACBETH.
:I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
:Give me my armour.

SEYTON.
:'Tis not needed yet.

MACBETH.
:I'll put it on.
:Send out more horses, skirr the country round;
:Hang those that talk of fear.—Give me mine armour.—
:How does your patient, doctor?

DOCTOR.
:Not so sick, my lord,
:As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
:That keep her from her rest.

MACBETH.
:Cure her of that:
:Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas'd;
:Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow;
:Raze out the written troubles of the brain;
:And with some sweet oblivious antidote
:Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
:Which weighs upon the heart?

DOCTOR.
:Therein the patient
:Must minister to himself.

MACBETH.
:Throw physic to the dogs,—I'll none of it.—
:Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff:—
:Seyton, send out.—Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.—
:Come, sir, despatch.—If thou couldst, doctor, cast
:The water of my land, find her disease,
:And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
:I would applaud thee to the very echo,
:That should applaud again.—Pull't off, I say.—
:What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,
:Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?

DOCTOR.
:Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
:Makes us hear something.

MACBETH.
:Bring it after me.—
:I will not be afraid of death and bane,
:Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

[Exeunt all except Doctor.]

DOCTOR.
:Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
:Profit again should hardly draw me here.

[Exit.]

=== SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood. ===

[Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, Ross, and Soldiers, marching.]

MALCOLM.
:Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
:That chambers will be safe.

MENTEITH.
:We doubt it nothing.

SIWARD.
:What wood is this before us?

MENTEITH.
:The wood of Birnam.

MALCOLM.
:Let every soldier hew him down a bough,
:And bear't before him; thereby shall we shadow
:The numbers of our host, and make discovery
:Err in report of us.

SOLDIERS.
:It shall be done.

SIWARD.
:We learn no other but the confident tyrant
:Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
:Our setting down before't.

MALCOLM.
:'Tis his main hope:
:For where there is advantage to be given,
:Both more and less have given him the revolt;
:And none serve with him but constrained things,
:Whose hearts are absent too.

MACDUFF.
:Let our just censures
:Attend the true event, and put we on
:Industrious soldiership.

SIWARD.
:The time approaches,
:That will with due decision make us know
:What we shall say we have, and what we owe.
:Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate;
:But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
:Towards which advance the war.

[Exeunt, marching.]

=== SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle. ===

[Enter with drum and colours, Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers.]

MACBETH.
:Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
:The cry is still, "They come:" our castle's strength
:Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
:Till famine and the ague eat them up:
:Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,
:We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
:And beat them backward home.

[A cry of women within.]

:What is that noise?

SEYTON.
:It is the cry of women, my good lord.

[Exit.]

MACBETH.
:I have almost forgot the taste of fears:
:The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
:To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
:Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
:As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
:Direness, familiar to my slaught'rous thoughts,
:Cannot once start me.

[Re-enter Seyton.]

:Wherefore was that cry?

SEYTON.
:The queen, my lord, is dead.

MACBETH.
:She should have died hereafter;
:There would have been a time for such a word.—
:To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
:Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
:To the last syllable of recorded time;
:And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
:The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
:Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player,
:That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
:And then is heard no more: it is a tale
:Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
:Signifying nothing.

[Enter a Messenger.]

Thou com'st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

MESSENGER.
:Gracious my lord,
:I should report that which I say I saw,
:But know not how to do it.

MACBETH.
:Well, say, sir.

MESSENGER.
:As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
:I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
:The wood began to move.

MACBETH.
:Liar, and slave!

[Striking him.]

MESSENGER.
:Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so.
:Within this three mile may you see it coming;
:I say, a moving grove.

MACBETH.
:If thou speak'st false,
:Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
:Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
:I care not if thou dost for me as much.—
:I pull in resolution; and begin
:To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
:That lies like truth. "Fear not, till Birnam wood
:Do come to Dunsinane;" and now a wood
:Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—
:If this which he avouches does appear,
:There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
:I 'gin to be a-weary of the sun,
:And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.—
:Ring the alarum bell!—Blow, wind! come, wrack!
:At least we'll die with harness on our back.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle. ===

[Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff, and their Army, with boughs.]

MALCOLM.
:Now near enough; your leafy screens throw down,
:And show like those you are.—You, worthy uncle,
:Shall with my cousin, your right-noble son,
:Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
:Shall take upon's what else remains to do,
:According to our order.

SIWARD.
:Fare you well.—
:Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
:Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

MACDUFF.
:Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
:Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE VII.  The same. Another part of the field. ===

[Alarums. Enter Macbeth.]

MACBETH.
:They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
:But, bear-like I must fight the course.—What's he
:That was not born of woman? Such a one
:Am I to fear, or none.

[Enter young Siward.]

YOUNG SIWARD.
:What is thy name?

MACBETH.
:Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

YOUNG SIWARD.
:No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
:Than any is in hell.

MACBETH.
:My name's Macbeth.

YOUNG SIWARD.
:The devil himself could not pronounce a title
:More hateful to mine ear.

MACBETH.
:No, nor more fearful.

YOUNG SIWARD.
:Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
:I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.

[They fight, and young Siward is slain.]

MACBETH.
:Thou wast born of woman.—
:But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
:Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.

[Exit.]

[Alarums. Enter Macduff.]

MACDUFF.
:That way the noise is.—Tyrant, show thy face!
:If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
:My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
:I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
:Are hired to bear their staves; either thou, Macbeth,
:Or else my sword, with an unbatter'd edge,
:I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
:By this great clatter, one of greatest note
:Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
:And more I beg not.

[Exit. Alarums.]

[Enter Malcolm and old Siward.]

SIWARD.
:This way, my lord;—the castle's gently render'd:
:The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
:The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
:The day almost itself professes yours,
:And little is to do.

MALCOLM.
:We have met with foes
:That strike beside us.

SIWARD.
:Enter, sir, the castle.

[Exeunt. Alarums.]

=== SCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field. ===

[Enter Macbeth.]

MACBETH.
:Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
:On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
:Do better upon them.

[Enter Macduff.]

MACDUFF.
:Turn, hell-hound, turn!

MACBETH.
:Of all men else I have avoided thee:
:But get thee back; my soul is too much charg'd
:With blood of thine already.

MACDUFF.
:I have no words,—
:My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
:Than terms can give thee out!

[They fight.]

MACBETH.
:Thou losest labour:
:As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
:With thy keen sword impress, as make me bleed:
:Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
:I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
:To one of woman born.

MACDUFF.
:Despair thy charm;
:And let the angel whom thou still hast serv'd
:Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
:Untimely ripp'd.

MACBETH.
:Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
:For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
:And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd,
:That palter with us in a double sense;
:That keep the word of promise to our ear,
:And break it to our hope!—I'll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF.
:Then yield thee, coward,
:And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
:We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
:Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
:"Here may you see the tyrant."

MACBETH.
:I will not yield,
:To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
:And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
:Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
:And thou oppos'd, being of no woman born,
:Yet I will try the last. Before my body
:I throw my warlike shield: lay on, Macduff;
:And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"

[Exeunt fighting. Alarums.]

[Re-enter fighting, and Macbeth is slain. Exit Macduff, with Macbeth's body.]

[Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, Malcolm, old Siward, Ross, Lennox, Angus, Caithness, Menteith, and Soldiers.]

MALCOLM.
:I would the friends we miss were safe arriv'd.

SIWARD.
:Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,
:So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM.
:Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS.
:Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
:He only liv'd but till he was a man;
:The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
:In the unshrinking station where he fought,
:But like a man he died.

SIWARD.
:Then he is dead?

ROSS.
:Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
:Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then
:It hath no end.

SIWARD.
:Had he his hurts before?

ROSS.
:Ay, on the front.

SIWARD.
:Why then, God's soldier be he!
:Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
:I would not wish them to a fairer death:
:And, so his knell is knoll'd.

MALCOLM.
:He's worth more sorrow,
:And that I'll spend for him.

SIWARD.
:He's worth no more:
:They say he parted well, and paid his score:
:And so, God be with him!—Here comes newer despair.

[Re-enter Macduff, with Macbeth's head.]

MACDUFF.
:Hail, king, for so thou art: behold, where stands
:The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
:I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl
:That speak my salutation in their minds;
:Whose voices I desire aloud with mine,—
:Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL.
:Hail, King of Scotland!

[Flourish.]

MALCOLM.
:We shall not spend a large expense of time
:Before we reckon with your several loves,
:And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
:Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
:In such an honour nam'd. What's more to do,
:Which would be planted newly with the time,—
:As calling home our exil'd friends abroad,
:That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
:Producing forth the cruel ministers
:Of this dead butcher, and his fiend-like queen,—
:Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
:Took off her life;—this, and what needful else
:That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
:We will perform in measure, time, and place:
:So, thanks to all at once, and to each one,
:Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.

[Flourish. Exeunt.]

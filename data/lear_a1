=== Scene I. A Room of State in King Lear's Palace. ===

[Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund]

Kent.
:I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than
:Cornwall.

Glou.
:It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the
:kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for
:equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make
:choice of either's moiety.

Kent.
:Is not this your son, my lord?

Glou.
:His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often
:blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.

Kent.
:I cannot conceive you.

Glou.
:Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon she grew
:round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she
:had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?

Kent.
:I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.

Glou.
:But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than
:this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came
:something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was
:his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
:whoreson must be acknowledged.—Do you know this noble gentleman,
:Edmund?

Edm.
:No, my lord.

Glou.
:My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.

Edm.
:My services to your lordship.

Kent.
:I must love you, and sue to know you better.

Edm.
:Sir, I shall study deserving.

Glou.
:He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.—The king
:is coming.

[Sennet within.]

[Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and
:Attendants.]

Lear.
:Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,
:Gloucester.

Glou.
:I shall, my liege.

[Exeunt Gloucester and Edmund.]

Lear.
:Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.—
:Give me the map there.—Know that we have divided
:In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
:To shake all cares and business from our age;
:Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
:Unburden'd crawl toward death.—Our son of Cornwall,
:And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
:We have this hour a constant will to publish
:Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
:May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
:Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
:Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
:And here are to be answer'd.—Tell me, my daughters,—
:Since now we will divest us both of rule,
:Interest of territory, cares of state,—
:Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
:That we our largest bounty may extend
:Where nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril,
:Our eldest-born, speak first.

Gon.
:Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
:Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;
:Beyond what can be valu'd, rich or rare;
:No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
:As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
:A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;
:Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

Cor.
:[Aside.] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.

Lear.
:Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
:With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
:With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
:We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
:Be this perpetual.—What says our second daughter,
:Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.

Reg.
:Sir, I am made of the selfsame metal that my sister is,
:And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
:I find she names my very deed of love;
:Only she comes too short,—that I profess
:Myself an enemy to all other joys
:Which the most precious square of sense possesses,
:And find I am alone felicitate
:In your dear highness' love.

Cor.
:[Aside.] Then poor Cordelia!
:And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
:More richer than my tongue.

Lear.
:To thee and thine hereditary ever
:Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
:No less in space, validity, and pleasure
:Than that conferr'd on Goneril.—Now, our joy,
:Although the last, not least; to whose young love
:The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
:Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
:A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

Cor.
:Nothing, my lord.

Lear.
:Nothing!

Cor.
:Nothing.

Lear.
:Nothing can come of nothing: speak again.

Cor.
:Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
:My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
:According to my bond; no more nor less.

Lear.
:How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
:Lest you may mar your fortunes.

Cor.
:Good my lord,
:You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I
:Return those duties back as are right fit,
:Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
:Why have my sisters husbands if they say
:They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
:That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
:Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
:Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
:To love my father all.

Lear.
:But goes thy heart with this?

Cor.
:Ay, good my lord.

Lear.
:So young, and so untender?

Cor.
:So young, my lord, and true.

Lear.
:Let it be so,—thy truth then be thy dower:
:For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
:The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
:By all the operation of the orbs,
:From whom we do exist and cease to be;
:Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
:Propinquity, and property of blood,
:And as a stranger to my heart and me
:Hold thee, from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
:Or he that makes his generation messes
:To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
:Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
:As thou my sometime daughter.

Kent.
:Good my liege,—

Lear.
:Peace, Kent!
:Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
:I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
:On her kind nursery.—Hence, and avoid my sight!—[To Cordelia.]
:So be my grave my peace, as here I give
:Her father's heart from her!—Call France;—who stirs?
:Call Burgundy!—Cornwall and Albany,
:With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
:Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
:I do invest you jointly in my power,
:Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
:That troop with majesty.—Ourself, by monthly course,
:With reservation of an hundred knights,
:By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
:Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
:The name, and all the additions to a king;
:The sway,
:Revenue, execution of the rest,
:Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,
:This coronet part betwixt you.
:[Giving the crown.]

Kent.
:Royal Lear,
:Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
:Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
:As my great patron thought on in my prayers.—

Lear.
:The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.

Kent.
:Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
:The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
:When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
:Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
:When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
:When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;
:And in thy best consideration check
:This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
:Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
:Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
:Reverbs no hollowness.

Lear.
:Kent, on thy life, no more.

Kent.
:My life I never held but as a pawn
:To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
:Thy safety being the motive.

Lear.
:Out of my sight!

Kent.
:See better, Lear; and let me still remain
:The true blank of thine eye.

Lear.
:Now, by Apollo,—

Kent.
:Now by Apollo, king,
:Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

Lear.
:O vassal! miscreant!

[Laying his hand on his sword.]

Alb. and Corn.
:Dear sir, forbear!

Kent.
:Do;
:Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
:Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
:Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
:I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

Lear.
:Hear me, recreant!
:On thine allegiance, hear me!—
:Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,—
:Which we durst never yet,—and with strain'd pride
:To come between our sentence and our power,—
:Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,—
:Our potency made good, take thy reward.
:Five days we do allot thee for provision
:To shield thee from diseases of the world;
:And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
:Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
:Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
:The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
:This shall not be revok'd.

Kent.
:Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
:Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.—
:[To Cordelia.] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
:That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!
:[To Regan and Goneril.]
:And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
:That good effects may spring from words of love.—
:Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
:He'll shape his old course in a country new.

[Exit.]

[Flourish. Re-enter Gloucester, with France, Burgundy, and
:Attendants.]

Glou.
:Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.

Lear.
:My Lord of Burgundy,
:We first address toward you, who with this king
:Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what in the least
:Will you require in present dower with her,
:Or cease your quest of love?

Bur.
:Most royal majesty,
:I crave no more than hath your highness offer'd,
:Nor will you tender less.

Lear.
:Right noble Burgundy,
:When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
:But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
:If aught within that little seeming substance,
:Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
:And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
:She's there, and she is yours.

Bur.
:I know no answer.

Lear.
:Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
:Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
:Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
:Take her, or leave her?

Bur.
:Pardon me, royal sir;
:Election makes not up on such conditions.

Lear.
:Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
:I tell you all her wealth.—[To France] For you, great king,
:I would not from your love make such a stray
:To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
:To avert your liking a more worthier way
:Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
:Almost to acknowledge hers.

France.
:This is most strange,
:That she, who even but now was your best object,
:The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
:Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
:Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
:So many folds of favour. Sure her offence
:Must be of such unnatural degree
:That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
:Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
:Must be a faith that reason without miracle
:Should never plant in me.

Cor.
:I yet beseech your majesty,—
:If for I want that glib and oily art
:To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
:I'll do't before I speak,—that you make known
:It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
:No unchaste action or dishonour'd step,
:That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;
:But even for want of that for which I am richer,—
:A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
:As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
:Hath lost me in your liking.

Lear.
:Better thou
:Hadst not been born than not to have pleas'd me better.

France.
:Is it but this,—a tardiness in nature
:Which often leaves the history unspoke
:That it intends to do?—My lord of Burgundy,
:What say you to the lady? Love's not love
:When it is mingled with regards that stands
:Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
:She is herself a dowry.

Bur.
:Royal king,
:Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,
:And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
:Duchess of Burgundy.

Lear.
:Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.

Bur.
:I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
:That you must lose a husband.

Cor.
:Peace be with Burgundy!
:Since that respects of fortune are his love,
:I shall not be his wife.

France.
:Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
:Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!
:Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
:Be it lawful, I take up what's cast away.
:Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
:My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.—
:Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
:Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
:Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
:Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.—
:Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
:Thou losest here, a better where to find.

Lear.
:Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
:Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
:That face of hers again.—Therefore be gone
:Without our grace, our love, our benison.—
:Come, noble Burgundy.

[Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloucester,
:and Attendants.]

France.
:Bid farewell to your sisters.

Cor.
:The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
:Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
:And, like a sister, am most loath to call
:Your faults as they are nam'd. Love well our father:
:To your professed bosoms I commit him:
:But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
:I would prefer him to a better place.
:So, farewell to you both.

Reg.
:Prescribe not us our duties.

Gon.
:Let your study
:Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you
:At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
:And well are worth the want that you have wanted.

Cor.
:Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides:
:Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
:Well may you prosper!

France.
:Come, my fair Cordelia.

[Exeunt France and Cordelia.]

Gon.
:Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
:appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night.

Reg.
:That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.

Gon.
:You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we
:have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our
:sister most; and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
:off appears too grossly.

Reg.
:'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly
:known himself.

Gon.
:The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must
:we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of
:long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
:that infirm and choleric years bring with them.

Reg.
:Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of
:Kent's banishment.

Gon.
:There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and
:him. Pray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority
:with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his
:will but offend us.

Reg.
:We shall further think of it.

Gon.
:We must do something, and i' th' heat.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene II.  A Hall in the Earl of Gloucester's Castle. ===

[Enter Edmund with a letter.]

Edm.
:Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
:My services are bound. Wherefore should I
:Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
:The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
:For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
:Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
:When my dimensions are as well compact,
:My mind as generous, and my shape as true
:As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
:With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
:Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
:More composition and fierce quality
:Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
:Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
:Got 'tween asleep and wake?—Well then,
:Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
:Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
:As to the legitimate: fine word—legitimate!
:Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
:And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
:Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper.—
:Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

[Enter Gloucester.]

Glou.
:Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
:And the king gone to-night! subscrib'd his pow'r!
:Confin'd to exhibition! All this done
:Upon the gad!—Edmund, how now! What news?

Edm.
:So please your lordship, none.

[Putting up the letter.]

Glou.
:Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?

Edm.
:I know no news, my lord.

Glou.
:What paper were you reading?

Edm.
:Nothing, my lord.

Glou.
:No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of it into your
:pocket? the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself.
:Let's see.
:Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.

Edm.
:I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother
:that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have perus'd,
:I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.

Glou.
:Give me the letter, sir.

Edm.
:I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in
:part I understand them, are to blame.

Glou.
:Let's see, let's see!

Edm.
:I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an
:essay or taste of my virtue.

Glou.
:[Reads.] 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world
:bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us
:till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle
:and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways,
:not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that
:of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I
:waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live
:the beloved of your brother,
:'EDGAR.'
:Hum! Conspiracy?—'Sleep till I waked him,—you should enjoy half
:his revenue.'—My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart
:and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? who brought it?

Edm.
:It was not brought me, my lord, there's the cunning of it; I
:found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.

Glou.
:You know the character to be your brother's?

Edm.
:If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but
:in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.

Glou.
:It is his.

Edm.
:It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the
:contents.

Glou.
:Hath he never before sounded you in this business?

Edm.
:Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
:that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father
:should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.

Glou.
:O villain, villain!—His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred
:villain!—Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than
:brutish!—Go, sirrah, seek him; I'll apprehend him. Abominable
:villain!—Where is he?

Edm.
:I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend
:your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
:better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;
:where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
:purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake
:in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
:for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
:honour, and to no other pretence of danger.

Glou.
:Think you so?

Edm.
:If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall
:hear us confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your
:satisfaction;
:and that without any further delay than this very evening.

Glou.
:He cannot be such a monster.

Edm.
:Nor is not, sure.

Glou.
:To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.—Heaven
:and earth!—Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you:
:frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself
:to be in a due resolution.

Edm.
:I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall
:find means, and acquaint you withal.

Glou.
:These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:
:though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet
:nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
:friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in
:countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked
:'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
:prediction; there's son against father: the king falls from
:bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the
:best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
:ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves.—Find out
:this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it
:carefully.—And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
:offence, honesty!—'Tis strange.

[Exit.]

Edm.
:This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are
:sick in fortune,—often the surfeit of our own behaviour,—we
:make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as
:if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
:knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
:drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
:planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
:thrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his
:goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded
:with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity was under
:ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.—Tut! I
:should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the
:firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.

[Enter Edgar.]

Pat!—he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue
:is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam.—O,
:these eclipses do portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.

Edg.
:How now, brother Edmund! what serious contemplation are you in?

Edm.
:I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,
:what should follow these eclipses.

Edg.
:Do you busy yourself with that?

Edm.
:I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of
:unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,
:dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
:maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences,
:banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,
:and I know not what.

Edg.
:How long have you been a sectary astronomical?

Edm.
:Come, come! when saw you my father last?

Edg.
:The night gone by.

Edm.
:Spake you with him?

Edg.
:Ay, two hours together.

Edm.
:Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word
:or countenance?

Edg.
:None at all.

Edm.
:Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my
:entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
:qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so
:rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
:scarcely allay.

Edg.
:Some villain hath done me wrong.

Edm.
:That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the
:speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to
:my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord
:speak: pray you, go; there's my key.—If you do stir abroad, go
:armed.

Edg.
:Armed, brother!

Edm.
:Brother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man
:if there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I
:have seen and heard but faintly; nothing like the image and
:horror of it: pray you, away!

Edg.
:Shall I hear from you anon?

Edm.
:I do serve you in this business.

[Exit Edgar.]

A credulous father! and a brother noble,
:Whose nature is so far from doing harms
:That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
:My practices ride easy!—I see the business.
:Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
:All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

[Exit.]

=== Scene III. A Room in the Duke of Albany's Palace. ===

[Enter Goneril and Oswald.]

Gon.
:Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?

Osw. Ay, madam.

Gon.
:By day and night, he wrongs me; every hour
:He flashes into one gross crime or other,
:That sets us all at odds; I'll not endure it:
:His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
:On every trifle.—When he returns from hunting,
:I will not speak with him; say I am sick.—
:If you come slack of former services,
:You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

Osw.
:He's coming, madam; I hear him.

[Horns within.]

Gon.
:Put on what weary negligence you please,
:You and your fellows; I'd have it come to question:
:If he distaste it, let him to our sister,
:Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
:Not to be overruled. Idle old man,
:That still would manage those authorities
:That he hath given away!—Now, by my life,
:Old fools are babes again; and must be us'd
:With checks as flatteries,—when they are seen abus'd.
:Remember what I have said.

Osw.
:Very well, madam.

Gon.
:And let his knights have colder looks among you;
:What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so;
:I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
:That I may speak.—I'll write straight to my sister
:To hold my very course.—Prepare for dinner.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene IV. A Hall in Albany's Palace. ===

[Enter Kent, disguised.]

Kent.
:If but as well I other accents borrow,
:That can my speech defuse, my good intent
:May carry through itself to that full issue
:For which I rais'd my likeness.—Now, banish'd Kent,
:If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
:So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,
:Shall find thee full of labours.

[Horns within. Enter King Lear, Knights, and Attendants.]

Lear.
:Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.

[Exit an Attendant.]

How now! what art thou?

Kent.
:A man, sir.

Lear.
:What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?

Kent.
:I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that
:will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse
:with him that is wise and says little; to fear judgment; to fight
:when I cannot choose; and to eat no fish.

Lear.
:What art thou?

Kent.
:A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.

Lear.
:If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou art
:poor enough. What wouldst thou?

Kent.
:Service.

Lear.
:Who wouldst thou serve?

Kent.
:You.

Lear.
:Dost thou know me, fellow?

Kent.
:No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain
:call master.

Lear.
:What's that?

Kent.
:Authority.

Lear.
:What services canst thou do?

Kent.
:I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in
:telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which
:ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of
:me is diligence.

Lear.
:How old art thou?

Kent.
:Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to
:dote on her for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.

Lear.
:Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after
:dinner, I will not part from thee yet.—Dinner, ho, dinner!—
:Where's my knave? my fool?—Go you and call my fool hither.

[Exit an attendant.]

[Enter Oswald.]

You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?

Osw.
:So please you,—

[Exit.]

Lear.
:What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.—

[Exit a Knight.]

Where's my fool, ho?—I think the world's asleep.

[Re-enter Knight.]

How now! where's that mongrel?

Knight.
:He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.

Lear.
:Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?

Knight.
:Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not.

Lear.
:He would not!

Knight.
:My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment your
:highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as
:you were wont; there's a great abatement of kindness appears as
:well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and
:your daughter.

Lear.
:Ha! say'st thou so?

Knight.
:I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty
:cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.

Lear.
:Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I have perceived
:a most faint neglect of late; which I have rather blamed as mine
:own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of
:unkindness: I will look further into't.—But where's my fool? I
:have not seen him this two days.

Knight.
:Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool hath much
:pined away.

Lear.
:No more of that; I have noted it well.—Go you and tell my
:daughter I would speak with her.—

[Exit Attendant.]

Go you, call hither my fool.

[Exit another Attendant.]

[Re-enter Oswald.]

:O, you, sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I, sir?

Osw.
:My lady's father.

Lear.
:My lady's father! my lord's knave: you whoreson dog! you slave!
:you cur!

Osw.
:I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.

Lear.
:Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
:[Striking him.]

Osw.
:I'll not be struck, my lord.

Kent.
:Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player.
:[Tripping up his heels.]

Lear.
:I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll love thee.

Kent.
:Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences: away, away!
:If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry; but away!
:go to; have you wisdom? so.
:[Pushes Oswald out.]

Lear.
:Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's earnest of thy
:service.
:[Giving Kent money.]

[Enter Fool.]

Fool. Let me hire him too; here's my coxcomb.
:[Giving Kent his cap.]

Lear.
:How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?

Fool.
:Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

Kent.
:Why, fool?

Fool.
:Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an thou
:canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly:
:there, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow hath banish'd two on's
:daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will; if
:thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.—How now,
:nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!

Lear.
:Why, my boy?

Fool.
:If I gave them all my living, I'd keep my coxcombs myself.
:There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.

Lear.
:Take heed, sirrah,—the whip.

Fool.
:Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out, when
:the lady brach may stand by the fire and stink.

Lear.
:A pestilent gall to me!

Fool.
:Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.

Lear.
:Do.

Fool.
:Mark it, nuncle:—
:    Have more than thou showest,
:    Speak less than thou knowest,
:    Lend less than thou owest,
:    Ride more than thou goest,
:    Learn more than thou trowest,
:    Set less than thou throwest;
:    Leave thy drink and thy whore,
:    And keep in-a-door,
:    And thou shalt have more
:    Than two tens to a score.

Kent.
:This is nothing, fool.

Fool.
:Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer,—you gave me
:nothing for't.—Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?

Lear.
:Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.

Fool.
:[to Kent] Pr'ythee tell him, so much the rent of his land
:comes to: he will not believe a fool.

Lear.
:A bitter fool!

Fool.
:Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and
:a sweet one?

Lear.
:No, lad; teach me.

Fool.
:   That lord that counsell'd thee
:     To give away thy land,
:   Come place him here by me,—
:     Do thou for him stand:
:   The sweet and bitter fool
:     Will presently appear;
:   The one in motley here,
:     The other found out there.

Lear.
:Dost thou call me fool, boy?

Fool.
:All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born
:with.

Kent.
:This is not altogether fool, my lord.

Fool.
:No, faith; lords and great men will not let me: if I had a
:monopoly out, they would have part on't and loads too: they
:will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be
:snatching.—Nuncle, give me an egg, and I'll give thee two
:crowns.

Lear.
:What two crowns shall they be?

Fool.
:Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle and eat up the
:meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i'
:the middle and gav'st away both parts, thou borest thine ass on
:thy back o'er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
:when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in
:this, let him be whipped that first finds it so.
:[Singing.]
:   Fools had ne'er less wit in a year; <!-- "wit" in the Quarto is replaced by "grace" in the Folio -->
:     For wise men are grown foppish,
:   And know not how their wits to wear,
:     Their manners are so apish.

Lear.
:When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

Fool.
:I have used it, nuncle, e'er since thou mad'st thy daughters thy
:mothers; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and puttest down
:thine own breeches,
:[Singing.]
:   Then they for sudden joy did weep,
:     And I for sorrow sung,
:   That such a king should play bo-peep
:     And go the fools among.

Pr'ythee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to
:lie; I would fain learn to lie.

Lear.
:An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

Fool.
:I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they'll have me
:whipped for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipped for lying;
:and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be
:any kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be thee,
:nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides, and left nothing
:i' the middle:—here comes one o' the parings.

[Enter Goneril.]

Lear.
:How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you
:are too much of late i' the frown.

Fool.
:Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for
:her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure: I am better
:than thou art; I am a fool, thou art nothing.—Yes, forsooth, I
:will hold my tongue. So your face [To Goneril.] bids me, though
:you say nothing. Mum, mum,
:     He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
:     Weary of all, shall want some.—
:[Pointing to Lear.] That's a shealed peascod.

Gon.
:Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
:But other of your insolent retinue
:Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
:In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
:I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
:To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
:By what yourself too late have spoke and done,
:That you protect this course, and put it on
:By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
:Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
:Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
:Might in their working do you that offence
:Which else were shame, that then necessity
:Will call discreet proceeding.

Fool.
:For you know, nuncle,
:   The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
:   That it had it head bit off by it young.
:So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

Lear.
:Are you our daughter?

Gon.
:Come, sir,
:I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
:Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
:These dispositions, that of late transform you
:From what you rightly are.

Fool.
:May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?—Whoop, Jug! I
:love thee!

Lear.
:Doth any here know me?—This is not Lear;
:Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
:Either his notion weakens, his discernings
:Are lethargied.—Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!—
:Who is it that can tell me who I am?

Fool.
:Lear's shadow.

Lear.
:I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,
:Knowledge, and reason,
:I should be false persuaded I had daughters.

Fool.
:Which they will make an obedient father.

Lear.
:Your name, fair gentlewoman?

Gon.
:This admiration, sir, is much o' the favour
:Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
:To understand my purposes aright:
:As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
:Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
:Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold
:That this our court, infected with their manners,
:Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
:Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
:Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak
:For instant remedy: be, then, desir'd
:By her that else will take the thing she begs
:A little to disquantity your train;
:And the remainder, that shall still depend,
:To be such men as may besort your age,
:Which know themselves, and you.

Lear.
:Darkness and devils!—
:Saddle my horses; call my train together.—
:Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee:
:Yet have I left a daughter.

Gon.
:You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
:Make servants of their betters.

[Enter Albany.]

Lear.
:Woe that too late repents!—
:[To Albany.] O, sir, are you come?
:Is it your will? Speak, sir.—Prepare my horses.—
:Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
:More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
:Than the sea-monster!

Alb.
:Pray, sir, be patient.

Lear.
:[to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!:
:My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
:That all particulars of duty know;
:And in the most exact regard support
:The worships of their name.—O most small fault,
:How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
:Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
:From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love,
:And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
:Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Striking his head.]
:And thy dear judgment out!—Go, go, my people.

Alb.
:My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
:Of what hath mov'd you.

Lear.
:It may be so, my lord.
:Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear
:Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
:To make this creature fruitful!
:Into her womb convey sterility!
:Dry up in her the organs of increase;
:And from her derogate body never spring
:A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
:Create her child of spleen, that it may live
:And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her!
:Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
:With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
:Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
:To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
:How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
:To have a thankless child!—Away, away!

[Exit.]

Alb.
:Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

Gon.
:Never afflict yourself to know more of it;
:But let his disposition have that scope
:That dotage gives it.

[Re-enter Lear.]

Lear.
:What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
:Within a fortnight!

Alb.
:What's the matter, sir?

Lear.
:I'll tell thee.—Life and death!—[To Goneril] I am asham'd
:That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
:That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
:Should make thee worth them.—Blasts and fogs upon thee!
:Th' untented woundings of a father's curse
:Pierce every sense about thee!—Old fond eyes,
:Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck you out,
:And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
:To temper clay. Ha!
:Let it be so: I have another daughter,
:Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
:When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
:She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
:That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
:I have cast off for ever.

[Exeunt Lear, Kent, and Attendants.]

Gon.
:Do you mark that?

Alb.
:I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
:To the great love I bear you,—

Gon.
:Pray you, content.—What, Oswald, ho!
:[To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

Fool.
:Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry,—take the fool with thee.—
:   A fox when one has caught her,
:   And such a daughter,
:   Should sure to the slaughter,
:   If my cap would buy a halter;
:   So the fool follows after.

[Exit.]

Gon.
:This man hath had good counsel.—A hundred knights!
:'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
:At point a hundred knights: yes, that on every dream,
:Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
:He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
:And hold our lives in mercy.—Oswald, I say!—

Alb.
:Well, you may fear too far.

Gon.
:Safer than trust too far:
:Let me still take away the harms I fear,
:Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
:What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister:
:If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
:When I have show'd th' unfitness,—

[Re-enter Oswald.]

:How now, Oswald!
:What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

Osw.
:Ay, madam.

Gon.
:Take you some company, and away to horse:
:Inform her full of my particular fear;
:And thereto add such reasons of your own
:As may compact it more. Get you gone;
:And hasten your return.

[Exit Oswald.]

No, no, my lord!
:This milky gentleness and course of yours,
:Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,
:You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
:Than prais'd for harmful mildness.

Alb.
:How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:
:Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

Gon.
:Nay then,—

Alb.
:Well, well; the event.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene V. Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace. ===

[Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.]

Lear.
:Go you before to Gloucester with these letters: acquaint my
:daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her
:demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I
:shall be there afore you.

Kent.
:I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter.

[Exit.]

Fool.
:If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger of kibes?

Lear.
:Ay, boy.

Fool.
:Then I pr'ythee be merry; thy wit shall not go slipshod.

Lear.
:Ha, ha, ha!

Fool.
:Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for though
:she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell
:what I can tell.

Lear.
:What canst tell, boy?

Fool.
:She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou
:canst tell why one's nose stands i' the middle on's face?

Lear.
:No.

Fool.
:Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a man
:cannot smell out, he may spy into.

Lear.
:I did her wrong,—

Fool.
:Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

Lear.
:No.

Fool.
:Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

Lear.
:Why?

Fool.
:Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters, and
:leave his horns without a case.

Lear.
:I will forget my nature. So kind a father!—Be my horses ready?

Fool.
:Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars are
:no more than seven is a pretty reason.

Lear.
:Because they are not eight?

Fool.
:Yes indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.

Lear.
:To tak't again perforce!—Monster ingratitude!

Fool.
:If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for being
:old before thy time.

Lear.
:How's that?

Fool.
:Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.

Lear.
:O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
:Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!—

[Enter Gentleman.]

How now? are the horses ready?

Gent.
:Ready, my lord.

Lear.
:Come, boy.

Fool.
:She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
:Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.

[Exeunt.]

== ACT I ==

=== SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace. ===

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:You do not meet a man but frowns.  Our bloods
:No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
:Still seem as does the King.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:But what's the matter?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
:He purpos'd to his wife's sole son—a widow
:That late he married—hath referr'd herself
:Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She's wedded,
:Her husband banish'd, she imprison'd; all
:Is outward sorrow; though I think the King
:Be touch'd at very heart.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:None but the King?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:He that hath lost her too; so is the Queen,
:That most desir'd the match:  but not a courtier,
:Although they wear their faces to the bent
:Of the King's looks, hath a heart that is not
:Glad at the thing they scowl at.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:And why so?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing
:Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her—
:I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
:And therefore banish'd—is a creature such
:As, to seek through the regions of the earth
:For one his like, there would be something failing
:In him that should compare. I do not think
:So fair an outward and such stuff within
:Endows a man but he.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:You speak him far.

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:I do extend him, sir, within himself;
:Crush him together rather than unfold
:His measure duly.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:What's his name and birth?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:I cannot delve him to the root.  His father
:Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
:Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
:But had his titles by Tenantius whom
:He serv'd with glory and admir'd success,
:So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
:And had, besides this gentleman in question,
:Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time,
:Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
:Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
:That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
:Big of this gentleman our theme, deceas'd
:As he was born. The King he takes the babe
:To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
:Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
:Puts to him all the learnings that his time
:Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
:As we do air, fast as 'twas minist'red,
:And in's spring became a harvest; liv'd in court—
:Which rare it is to do—most prais'd, most lov'd,
:A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
:A glass that feated them, and to the graver
:A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
:For whom he now is banish'd—her own price
:Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
:By her election may be truly read
:What kind of man he is.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:I honour him
:Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
:Is she sole child to the King?

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:His only child.
:He had two sons,—if this be worth your hearing,
:Mark it—the eldest of them at three years old,
:I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
:Were stolen, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
:Which way they went.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:How long is this ago?

FIRST GENTLEMAN. Some twenty years.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:That a king's children should be so convey'd,
:So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
:That could not trace them!

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
:Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
:Yet is it true, sir.

SECOND GENTLEMAN.
:I do well believe you.

FIRST GENTLEMAN.
:We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,
:The Queen, and Princess.

[Exeunt.]

[Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS, and IMOGEN.]

QUEEN.
:No, be assur'd you shall not find me, daughter,
:After the slander of most stepmothers,
:Evil-ey'd unto you. You're my prisoner, but
:Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
:That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
:So soon as I can win the offended King,
:I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
:The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
:You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
:Your wisdom may inform you.

POSTHUMUS.
:Please your Highness,
:I will from hence to-day.

QUEEN.
:You know the peril.
:I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
:The pangs of barr'd affections, though the King
:Hath charg'd you should not speak together.

[Exit.]

IMOGEN.
:O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
:Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
:I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing—
:Always reserv'd my holy duty—what
:His rage can do on me. You must be gone;
:And I shall here abide the hourly shot
:Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
:But that there is this jewel in the world
:That I may see again.

POSTHUMUS.
:My queen! my mistress!
:O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
:To be suspected of more tenderness
:Than doth become a man. I will remain
:The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth.
:My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
:Who to my father was a friend, to me
:Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
:And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
:Though ink be made of gall.

[Re-enter QUEEN.]

QUEEN.
:Be brief, I pray you.
:If the King come, I shall incur I know not
:How much of his displeasure.

[Aside.]

Yet I'll move him
:To walk this way. I never do him wrong
:But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
:Pays dear for my offences.

[Exit.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Should we be taking leave
:As long a term as yet we have to live,
:The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

IMOGEN.
:Nay, stay a little.
:Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
:Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
:This diamond was my mother's.  Take it, heart;
:But keep it till you woo another wife,
:When Imogen is dead.

POSTHUMUS.
:How, how!  another?
:You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
:And cere up my embracements from a next
:With bonds of death! Remain, remain thou here

[Putting on the ring.]

While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
:As I my poor self did exchange for you,
:To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
:I still win of you; for my sake wear this.
:It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
:Upon this fairest prisoner.

[Putting a bracelet upon her arm.]

IMOGEN.
:O the gods!
:When shall we see again?

[Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS.]

POSTHUMUS.
:Alack, the King!

CYMBELINE.
:Thou basest thing, avoid!  Hence, from my sight!
:If after this command thou fraught the court
:With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
:Thou'rt poison to my blood.

POSTHUMUS.
:The gods protect you!
:And bless the good remainders of the court!
:I am gone.

[Exit.]

IMOGEN.
:There cannot be a pinch in death
:More sharp than this is.

CYMBELINE.
:O disloyal thing,
:That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
:A year's age on me!

IMOGEN.
:I beseech you, sir,
:Harm not yourself with your vexation.
:I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
:Subdues all pangs, all fears.

CYMBELINE.
:Past grace? obedience?

IMOGEN.
:Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

CYMBELINE.
:That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

IMOGEN.
:O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
:And did avoid a puttock.

CYMBELINE.
:Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
:A seat for baseness.

IMOGEN.
:No; I rather added
:A lustre to it.

CYMBELINE.
:O thou vile one!

IMOGEN.
:Sir, It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus.
:You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
:A man worth any woman; overbuys me
:Almost the sum he pays.

CYMBELINE.
:What, art thou mad?

IMOGEN.
:Almost, sir; heaven restore me! Would I were
:A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
:Our neighbour shepherd's son!

[Re-enter QUEEN.]

CYMBELINE. Thou foolish thing!
:—They were again together; you have done
:Not after our command. Away with her,
:And pen her up.

QUEEN.
:Beseech your patience.  Peace,
:Dear lady daughter, peace!  Sweet sovereign,
:Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort
:Out of your best advice.

CYMBELINE.
:Nay, let her languish
:A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
:Die of this folly!

[Exeunt CYMBELINE and LORDS.]

[Enter PISANIO.]

QUEEN.
:Fie! you must give way.
:Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

PISANIO.
:My lord your son drew on my master.

QUEEN.
:Ha! No harm, I trust, is done?

PISANIO.
:There might have been,
:But that my master rather play'd than fought
:And had no help of anger.  They were parted
:By gentlemen at hand.

QUEEN.
:I am very glad on't.

IMOGEN.
:Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part
:To draw upon an exile. O brave sir!
:I would they were in Afric both together;
:Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
:The goer-back. Why came you from your master?

PISANIO.
:On his command. He would not suffer me
:To bring him to the haven; left these notes
:Of what commands I should be subject to,
:When't pleas'd you to employ me.

QUEEN.
:This hath been
:Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honour
:He will remain so.

PISANIO.
:I humbly thank your Highness.

QUEEN.
:Pray, walk a while.

IMOGEN.
:About some half-hour hence,
:I Pray you, speak with me; you shall at least
:Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE II. The same. A public place. ===

[Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS.]

FIRST LORD.
:Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action 
:hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air 
:comes in; there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

CLOTEN.
:If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

No, faith; not so much as his patience.

FIRST LORD.
:Hurt him! His body's a passable carcass, if he be not
:hurt; it is a throughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

His steel was in debt; it went o' the backside the town.

CLOTEN.
:The villain would not stand me.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

FIRST LORD.
:Stand you! You have land enough of your own; but he
:added to your having, gave you some ground.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

As many inches as you have oceans.  Puppies!

CLOTEN.
:I would they had not come between us.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

So would I, till you had measur'd how long a fool you 
:were upon the ground.

CLOTEN.
:And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn'd.

FIRST LORD.
:Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain go
:not together.  She's a good sign, but I have seen small
:reflection
:of her wit.

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.

CLOTEN.
:Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt
:done!

SECOND LORD.

[Aside.]

I wish not so; unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no
:great hurt.

CLOTEN.
:You'll go with us?

FIRST LORD.
:I'll attend your lordship.

CLOTEN.
:Nay, come, let's go together.

SECOND LORD.
:Well, my lord.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE III. A room in CYMBELINE'S palace. ===

[Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO.]

IMOGEN.
:I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
:And question'dst every sail.  If he should write
:And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
:As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
:That he spake to thee?

PISANIO.
:It was his queen, his queen!

IMOGEN.
:Then wav'd his handkerchief?

PISANIO.
:And kiss'd it, madam.

IMOGEN.
:Senseless linen! happier therein than I!
:And that was all?

PISANIO.
:No, madam; for so long
:As he could make me with this eye or ear
:Distinguish him from others, he did keep
:The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
:Still waving, as the fits and stirs of's mind
:Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
:How swift his ship.

IMOGEN.
:Thou shouldst have made him
:As little as a crow, or less, ere left
:To after-eye him.

PISANIO.
:Madam, so I did.

IMOGEN.
:I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
:To look upon him, till the diminution
:Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;
:Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
:The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
:Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
:When shall we hear from him?

PISANIO.
:Be assured, madam,
:With his next vantage.

IMOGEN.
:I did not take my leave of him, but had
:Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him
:How I would think on him at certain hours
:Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
:The shes of Italy should not betray
:Mine interest and his honour, or have charg'd him,
:At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
:To encounter me with orisons, for then
:I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
:Give him that parting kiss which I had set
:Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
:And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
:Shakes all our buds from growing.

[Enter a LADY.]

LADY.
:The Queen, madam,
:Desires your Highness' company.

IMOGEN.
:Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
:I will attend the Queen.

PISANIO.
:Madam, I shall.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE IV. Rome. PHILARIO'S house. ===

[Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a FRENCHMAN, a DUTCHMAN, and a SPANIARD.]

IACHIMO.
:Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain. He was then of a 
:crescent note, expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
:been allowed the name of; but I could then have look'd on him
:without the help of admiration, though the catalogue of his
:endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by
:items.

PHILARIO.
:You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he
:is with that which makes him both without and within.

FRENCHMAN.
:I have seen him in France.  We had very many there could
:behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.

IACHIMO.
:This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein he
:must be weighed rather by her value than his own, words him, I
:doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

FRENCHMAN.
:And then his banishment.

IACHIMO.
:Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
:divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him; be it
:but to fortify her judgement, which else an easy battery might
:lay flat, for taking a beggar without less quality. But how
:comes it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps acquaintance?

PHILARIO.
:His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I have been 
:often bound for no less than my life.

[Enter POSTHUMUS.]

Here comes the Briton. Let him be so entertained amongst you as
:suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
:quality.—I beseech you all, be better known to this gentleman,
:whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine. How worthy he
:is I will leave to appear hereafter, rather than story him in
:his own hearing.

FRENCHMAN.
:Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

POSTHUMUS.
:Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
:which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.

FRENCHMAN.
:Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness. I was glad I did atone my 
:countryman and you.  It had been pity you should have been put
:together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore, upon 
:importance of so slight and trivial a nature.

POSTHUMUS.
:By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller; rather shunn'd
:to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided
:by others' experiences: but upon my mended judgement—if I offend
:[not] to say it is mended—my quarrel was not altogether slight.

FRENCHMAN.
:Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such
:two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other, or
:have fallen both.

IACHIMO.
:Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?

FRENCHMAN.
:Safely, I think; 'twas a contention in public, which may, without
:contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument
:that fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our
:country-mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching—and
:upon warrant of bloody affirmation—his to be more fair, virtuous,
:wise, chaste, constant, qualified, and less attemptable than any
:the rarest of our ladies in France.

IACHIMO.
:That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's opinion by this
:worn out.

POSTHUMUS.
:She holds her virtue still, and I my mind.

IACHIMO.
:You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.

POSTHUMUS.
:Being so far provok'd as I was in France, I would abate her
:nothing, though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.

IACHIMO.
:As fair and as good—a kind of hand-in-hand comparison—had been 
:something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain.  If she
:went before others I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
:many I have beheld, I could not [but] believe she excelled many.
:But I have not seen the most precious diamond that is, nor you the
:lady.

POSTHUMUS.
:I prais'd her as I rated her; so do I my stone.

IACHIMO.
:What do you esteem it at?

POSTHUMUS.
:More than the world enjoys.

IACHIMO.
:Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead, or she's outpriz'd by a
:trifle.

POSTHUMUS.
:You are mistaken.  The one may be sold, or given, if there were
:wealth enough for the purchase, or merit for the gift; the other is
:not a thing for sale, and only the gift of the gods.

IACHIMO.
:Which the gods have given you?

POSTHUMUS.
:Which, by their graces, I will keep.

IACHIMO.
:You may wear her in title yours; but, you know, strange fowl
:light upon neighbouring ponds. Your ring may be stolen too;
:so your brace of unprizable estimations, the one is but frail
:and the other casual.  A cunning thief, or a that-way-
:accomplish'd courtier, would hazard the winning both of first
:and last.

POSTHUMUS.
:Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to convince
:the honour of my mistress, if, in the holding or loss of that,
:you term her frail. I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
:notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.

PHILARIO.
:Let us leave here, gentlemen.

POSTHUMUS.
:Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I thank him, makes
:no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.

IACHIMO.
:With five times so much conversation, I should get ground of your
:fair mistress, make her go back, even to the yielding, had I
:admittance, and opportunity to friend.

POSTHUMUS.
:No, no.

IACHIMO.
:I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring;
:which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it something. But I make my
:wager rather against your confidence than her reputation; and,
:to bar your offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
:lady in the world.

POSTHUMUS.
:You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion; and I doubt
:not you sustain what you're worthy of by your attempt.

IACHIMO.
:What's that?

POSTHUMUS.
:A repulse; though your attempt, as you call it, deserve more,—a
:punishment too.

PHILARIO.
:Gentlemen, enough of this; it came in too suddenly.  Let it die
:as it was born, and, I pray you, be better acquainted.

IACHIMO.
:Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the approbation
:of what I have spoke!

POSTHUMUS.
:What lady would you choose to assail?

IACHIMO.
:Yours, whom in constancy you think stands so safe. I will lay you
:ten thousand ducats to your ring, that, commend me to the court
:where your lady is, with no more advantage than the opportunity of
:a second conference, and I will bring from thence that honour of
:hers which you imagine so reserv'd.

POSTHUMUS.
:I will wage against your gold, gold to it. My ring I hold dear as
:my finger; 'tis part of it.

IACHIMO.
:You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy ladies' flesh
:at a million a dram, you cannot preserve it from tainting. But I
:see you have some religion in you, that you fear.

POSTHUMUS.
:This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a graver purpose, I
:hope.

IACHIMO.
:I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo what's spoken,
:I swear.

POSTHUMUS.
:Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return.  Let
:there be covenants drawn between's. My mistress exceeds in
:goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking. I dare you to
:this match: here's my ring.

PHILARIO.
:I will have it no lay.

IACHIMO.
:By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no sufficient testimony
:that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your mistress, my
:ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your diamond too. If I come
:off, and leave her in such honour as you have trust in, she your
:jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours; provided I have
:your commendation for my more free entertainment.

POSTHUMUS.
:I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us.
:Only, thus far you shall answer: if you make your voyage upon her
:and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd, I am no
:further your enemy; she is not worth our debate.  If she remain
:unseduc'd, you not making it appear otherwise, for your ill
:opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall
:answer me with your sword.

IACHIMO.
:Your hand; a covenant. We will have these things set down by
:lawful counsel, and straight away for Britain, lest the bargain
:should catch cold and starve. I will fetch my gold and have our
:two wagers recorded.

POSTHUMUS.
:Agreed.

[Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO.]

FRENCHMAN.
:Will this hold, think you?

PHILARIO.
:Signior Iachimo will not from it. Pray, let us follow 'em.

[Exeunt.]

=== SCENE V. Britain. A room in CYMBELINE'S palace. ===

[Enter QUEEN, LADIES, and CORNELIUS.]

QUEEN.
:Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
:Make haste.  Who has the note of them?

FIRST LADY.
:I, madam.

QUEEN.
:Dispatch.

[Exeunt LADIES.]

Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

CORNELIUS.
:Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.

[Presenting a small box.]

But I beseech your Grace, without offence,—
:My conscience bids me ask—wherefore you have
:Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,
:Which are the movers of a languishing death,
:But though slow, deadly?

QUEEN.
:I wonder, doctor,
:Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
:Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
:To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
:That our great king himself doth woo me oft
:For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,—
:Unless thou think'st me devilish—is't not meet
:That I did amplify my judgement in
:Other conclusions? I will try the forces
:Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
:We count not worth the hanging,—but none human—
:To try the vigour of them and apply
:Allayments to their act, and by them gather
:Their several virtues and effects.

CORNELIUS.
:Your Highness
:Shall from this practice but make hard your heart.
:Besides, the seeing these effects will be
:Both noisome and infectious.

QUEEN. O, content thee.

[Enter PISANIO.]

[Aside.]

Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
:Will I first work. He's for his master,
:An enemy to my son.  How now, Pisanio!
:Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
:Take your own way.

CORNELIUS.

[Aside.]

I do suspect you, madam;
:But you shall do no harm.

QUEEN.

[To PISANIO]

Hark thee, a word.

CORNELIUS.

[Aside.]

I do not like her. She doth think she has
:Strange ling'ring poisons. I do know her spirit,
:And will not trust one of her malice with
:A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
:Will stupefy and dull the sense a while,
:Which first, perchance, she'll prove on cats and dogs,
:Then afterward up higher; but there is
:No danger in what show of death it makes,
:More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
:To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
:With a most false effect; and I the truer,
:So to be false with her.

QUEEN.
:No further service, doctor,
:Until I send for thee.

CORNELIUS.
:I humbly take my leave.

[Exit.]

QUEEN.
:Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
:She will not quench and let instructions enter
:Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
:When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
:I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
:As great as is thy master,—greater, for
:His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
:Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
:Continue where he is. To shift his being
:Is to exchange one misery with another,
:And every day that comes comes to
:A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
:To be depender on a thing that leans,
:Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
:So much as but to prop him?

[The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up.]

Thou tak'st up
:Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour.
:It is a thing I made, which hath the King
:Five times redeem'd from death. I do not know
:What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee, take it;
:It is an earnest of a further good
:That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
:The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
:Think what a chance thou changest on; but think
:Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
:Who shall take notice of thee. I'll move the King
:To any shape of thy preferment such
:As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
:That set thee on to this desert, am bound
:To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
:Think on my words.

[Exit PISANIO.]

A sly and constant knave,
:Not to be shak'd; the agent for his master
:And the remembrancer of her to hold
:The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
:Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
:Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
:Except she bend her humour, shall be assur'd
:To taste of too.

[Re-enter PISANIO and LADIES.]

So, so; well done, well done.
:The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
:Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
:Think on my words.

[Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES.]

PISANIO.
:And shall do;
:But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
:I'll choke myself.  There's all I'll do for you.

[Exit.]

=== SCENE VI. The same.  Another room in the palace. ===

[Enter IMOGEN.]

IMOGEN.
:A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
:A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
:That hath her husband banish'd;—O, that husband!
:My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
:Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stolen,
:As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
:Is the desire that's glorious. Blessed be those,
:How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
:Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

[Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO.]

PISANIO.
:Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome
:Comes from my lord with letters.

IACHIMO.
:Change you, madam?
:The worthy Leonatus is in safety
:And greets your Highness dearly.

[Presents a letter]

IMOGEN.
:Thanks, good sir;
:You're kindly welcome.

IACHIMO.

[Aside.]

All of her that is out of door most rich!
:If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
:She is alone, the Arabian bird, and I
:Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
:Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
:Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
:Rather, directly fly.

IMOGEN.

[Reads]

"—He is one of the noblest note, to whose
:kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him
:accordingly, as you value your trust—  LEONATUS"

So far I read aloud—
:But even the very middle of my heart
:Is warm'd by the rest—and take it thankfully.
:You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
:Have words to bid you; and shall find it so
:In all that I can do.

IACHIMO.
:Thanks, fairest lady.
:What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
:To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
:Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
:The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
:Upon the number'd beach, and can we not
:Partition make with spectacles so precious
:'Twixt fair and foul?

IMOGEN.
:What makes your admiration?

IACHIMO.
:It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
:'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
:Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgement,
:For idiots in this case of favour would
:Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
:Sluttery to such neat excellence oppos'd
:Should make desire vomit emptiness,
:Not so allur'd to feed.

IMOGEN.
:What is the matter, trow?

IACHIMO.
:The cloyed will,—
:That satiate yet unsatisfi'd desire, that tub
:Both fill'd and running,—ravening first the lamb,
:Longs after for the garbage.

IMOGEN.
:What, dear sir,
:Thus raps you? Are you well?

IACHIMO.
:Thanks, madam; well.

[To PISANIO.]

Beseech you, sir, desire 
:My man's abode where I did leave him.
:He is strange and peevish.

PISANIO.
:I was going, sir,
:To give him welcome.

[Exit.]

IMOGEN.
:Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

IACHIMO.
:Well, madam.

IMOGEN.
:Is he dispos'd to mirth? I hope he is.

IACHIMO.
:Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
:So merry and so gamesome. He is call'd
:The Briton reveller.

IMOGEN.
:When he was here,
:He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
:Not knowing why.

IACHIMO.
:I never saw him sad.
:There is a Frenchman his companion, one
:An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
:A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
:The thick sighs from him; whiles the jolly Briton—
:Your lord, I mean—laughs from's free lungs, cries "O,
:Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
:By history, report, or his own proof,
:What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
:But must be, will his free hours languish for
:Assured bondage?"

IMOGEN.
:Will my lord say so?

IACHIMO.
:Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.
:It is a recreation to be by
:And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
:Some men are much to blame.

IMOGEN.
:Not he, I hope.

IACHIMO.
:Not he; but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
:Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
:In you—which I account his—beyond all talents.
:Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
:To pity too.

IMOGEN.
:What do you pity, sir?

IACHIMO.
:Two creatures heartily.

IMOGEN.
:Am I one, sir?
:You look on me; what wreck discern you in me
:Deserves your pity?

IACHIMO.
:Lamentable! What,
:To hide me from the radiant sun, and solace
:I' the dungeon by a snuff?

IMOGEN.
:I pray you, sir,
:Deliver with more openness your answers
:To my demands. Why do you pity me?

IACHIMO.
:That others do,
:I was about to say, enjoy your—But
:It is an office of the gods to venge it,
:Not mine to speak on't.

IMOGEN.
:You do seem to know
:Something of me, or what concerns me:  pray you,—
:Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
:Than to be sure they do; for certainties
:Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
:The remedy then born—discover to me
:What both you spur and stop.

IACHIMO.
:Had I this cheek
:To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
:Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
:To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
:Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
:Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
:Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
:That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
:Made hard with hourly falsehood—falsehood, as
:With labour; then lie peeping in an eye
:Base and illustrious as the smoky light
:That's fed with stinking tallow:  it were fit
:That all the plagues of hell should at one time
:Encounter such revolt.

IMOGEN.
:My lord, I fear,
:Has forgot Britain.

IACHIMO.
:And himself. Not I,
:Inclin'd to this intelligence, pronounce
:The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
:That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
:Charms this report out.

IMOGEN.
:Let me hear no more.

IACHIMO.
:O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
:With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
:So fair, and fasten'd to an empery
:Would make the great'st king double,—to be partner'd
:With tomboys hir'd with that self-exhibition
:Which your own coffers yield! with diseas'd ventures
:That play with all infirmities for gold
:Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
:As well might poison poison! Be reveng'd;
:Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
:Recoil from your great stock.

IMOGEN.
:Reveng'd!
:How should I be reveng'd? If this be true,
:As I have such a heart that both mine ears
:Must not in haste abuse—if it be true,
:How should I be reveng'd?

IACHIMO.
:Should he make me
:Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
:Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
:In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
:I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
:More noble than that runagate to your bed,
:And will continue fast to your affection,
:Still close as sure.

IMOGEN.
:What ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO.
:Let me my service tender on your lips.

IMOGEN.
:Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
:So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
:Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
:For such an end thou seek'st,—as base as strange.
:Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
:From thy report as thou from honour, and
:Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
:Thee and the devil alike.  What, ho, Pisanio!
:The King my father shall be made acquainted
:Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit
:A saucy stranger in his court to mart
:As in a Romish stew, and to expound
:His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
:He little cares for and a daughter who
:He not respects at all.  What, ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO.
:O happy Leonatus! I may say.
:The credit that thy lady hath of thee
:Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
:Her assur'd credit. Blessed live you long
:A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
:Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
:For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
:I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
:Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord,
:That which he is, new o'er; and he is one
:The truest manner'd, such a holy witch
:That he enchants societies into him;
:Half all men's hearts are his.

IMOGEN.
:You make amends.

IACHIMO.
:He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
:He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
:More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
:Most mighty princess, that I have adventur'd
:To try your taking of a false report; which hath
:Honour'd with confirmation your great judgement
:In the election of a sir so rare,
:Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
:Made me to fan you thus; but the gods made you,
:Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

IMOGEN.
:All's well, sir.  Take my power i' the court for yours.

IACHIMO.
:My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
:To entreat your Grace but in a small request,
:And yet of moment too, for it concerns
:Your lord, myself, and other noble friends,
:Are partners in the business.

IMOGEN.
:Pray, what is't?

IACHIMO.
:Some dozen Romans of us and your lord—
:The best feather of our wing—have mingled sums
:To buy a present for the Emperor;
:Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
:In France. 'Tis plate of rare device, and jewels
:Of rich and exquisite form, their values great;
:And I am something curious, being strange,
:To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
:To take them in protection?

IMOGEN.
:Willingly;
:And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
:My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
:In my bedchamber.

IACHIMO.
:They are in a trunk,
:Attended by my men. I will make bold
:To send them to you, only for this night;
:I must aboard to-morrow.

IMOGEN.
:O, no, no.

IACHIMO.
:Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
:By lengthening my return. From Gallia
:I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
:To see your Grace.

IMOGEN.
:I thank you for your pains:
:But not away to-morrow!

IACHIMO.
:O, I must, madam;
:Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
:To greet your lord with writing; do't to-night.
:I have outstood my time; which is material
:To the tender of our present.

IMOGEN.
:I will write.
:Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
:And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.

[Exeunt.]

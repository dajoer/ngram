== ACT II. ==

=== Scene I. A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester. ===

[Enter Edmund and Curan, meeting.]

Edm.
:Save thee, Curan.

Cur.
:And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him
:notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be
:here with him this night.

Edm.
:How comes that?

Cur.
:Nay, I know not.—You have heard of the news abroad; I mean the
:whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?

Edm.
:Not I: pray you, what are they?

Cur.
:Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the two dukes
:of Cornwall and Albany?

Edm.
:Not a word.

Cur.
:You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.

[Exit.]

Edm.
:The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
:This weaves itself perforce into my business.
:My father hath set guard to take my brother;
:And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
:Which I must act:—briefness and fortune work!—
:Brother, a word!—descend:—brother, I say!

[Enter Edgar.]

:My father watches:—sir, fly this place;
:Intelligence is given where you are hid;
:You have now the good advantage of the night.—
:Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
:He's coming hither; now, i' the night, i' the haste,
:And Regan with him: have you nothing said
:Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
:Advise yourself.

Edg.
:I am sure on't, not a word.

Edm.
:I hear my father coming:—pardon me;
:In cunning I must draw my sword upon you:—
:Draw: seem to defend yourself: now quit you well.—
:Yield:—come before my father.—Light, ho, here!
:Fly, brother.—Torches, torches!—So farewell.

[Exit Edgar.]

:Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
:Of my more fierce endeavour: [Wounds his arm.]
:I have seen drunkards
:Do more than this in sport.—Father, father!
:Stop, stop! No help?

[Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.]

Glou.
:Now, Edmund, where's the villain?

Edm.
:Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
:Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
:To stand auspicious mistress,—

Glou.
:But where is he?

Edm.
:Look, sir, I bleed.

Glou.
:Where is the villain, Edmund?

Edm.
:Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could,—

Glou.
:Pursue him, ho!—Go after.

[Exeunt Servants.]

—By no means what?

Edm.
:Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
:But that I told him the revenging gods
:'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
:Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
:The child was bound to the father;—sir, in fine,
:Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
:To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion
:With his prepared sword, he charges home
:My unprovided body, lanc'd mine arm;
:But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
:Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to the encounter,
:Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
:Full suddenly he fled.

Glou.
:Let him fly far;
:Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
:And found—dispatch'd.—The noble duke my master,
:My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
:By his authority I will proclaim it,
:That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
:Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
:He that conceals him, death.

Edm.
:When I dissuaded him from his intent,
:And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
:I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
:'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
:If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
:Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
:Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny
:As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
:My very character, I'd turn it all
:To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:
:And thou must make a dullard of the world,
:If they not thought the profits of my death
:Were very pregnant and potential spurs
:To make thee seek it.

Glou.
:Strong and fast'ned villain!
:Would he deny his letter?—I never got him.

[Trumpets within.]

:Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.—
:All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;
:The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
:I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
:May have due note of him; and of my land,
:Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
:To make thee capable.

[Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.]

Corn.
:How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,—
:Which I can call but now,—I have heard strange news.

Reg.
:If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
:Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?

Glou.
:O madam, my old heart is crack'd,—it's crack'd!

Reg.
:What, did my father's godson seek your life?
:He whom my father nam'd? your Edgar?

Glou.
:O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

Reg.
:Was he not companion with the riotous knights
:That tend upon my father?

Glou.
:I know not, madam:—
:It is too bad, too bad.

Edm.
:Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

Reg.
:No marvel then though he were ill affected:
:'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
:To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
:I have this present evening from my sister
:Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions
:That if they come to sojourn at my house,
:I'll not be there.

Corn.
:Nor I, assure thee, Regan.—
:Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
:A childlike office.

Edm.
:'Twas my duty, sir.

Glou.
:He did bewray his practice; and receiv'd
:This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

Corn.
:Is he pursu'd?

Glou.
:Ay, my good lord.

Corn.
:If he be taken, he shall never more
:Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
:How in my strength you please.—For you, Edmund,
:Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
:So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
:Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
:You we first seize on.

Edm.
:I shall serve you, sir,
:Truly, however else.

Glou.
:For him I thank your grace.

Corn.
:You know not why we came to visit you,—

Reg.
:Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night:
:Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
:Wherein we must have use of your advice:—
:Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
:Of differences, which I best thought it fit
:To answer from our home; the several messengers
:From hence attend despatch. Our good old friend,
:Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
:Your needful counsel to our business,
:Which craves the instant use.

Glou.
:I serve you, madam:
:Your graces are right welcome.

[Exeunt.]

=== Scene II. Before Gloucester's Castle. ===

[Enter Kent and Oswald, severally.]

Osw.
:Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?

Kent.
:Ay.

Osw.
:Where may we set our horses?

Kent.
:I' the mire.

Osw.
:Pr'ythee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.

Kent.
:I love thee not.

Osw.
:Why then, I care not for thee.

Kent.
:If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me.

Osw.
:Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.

Kent.
:Fellow, I know thee.

Osw.
:What dost thou know me for?

Kent.
:A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,
:shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,
:worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson,
:glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;
:one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
:good service, and art nothing but the composition of a
:knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel
:bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou
:denyest the least syllable of thy addition.

Osw.
:Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that's
:neither known of thee nor knows thee?

Kent.
:What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is
:it two days ago since I beat thee and tripped up thy heels before
:the king? Draw, you rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
:shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you: draw, you
:whoreson cullionly barbermonger, draw!

[Drawing his sword.]

Osw.
:Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

Kent.
:Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the king; and
:take vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father:
:draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks:—
:draw, you rascal; come your ways!

Osw.
:Help, ho! murder! help!

Kent.
:Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat slave, strike!

[Beating him.]

Osw.
:Help, ho! murder! murder!

[Enter Edmund, Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, and Servants.]

Edm.
:How now! What's the matter?

Kent.
:With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll flesh you; come
:on, young master.

Glou.
:Weapons! arms! What's the matter here?

Corn.
:Keep peace, upon your lives;
:He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?

Reg.
:The messengers from our sister and the king.

Corn.
:What is your difference? speak.

Osw.
:I am scarce in breath, my lord.

Kent.
:No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You cowardly
:rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.

Corn.
:Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?

Kent.
:Ay, a tailor, sir: a stonecutter or a painter could not have
:made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the trade.

Corn.
:Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

Osw.
:This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of
:his grey
:beard,—

Kent.
:Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter!—My lord, if you'll
:give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and
:daub the walls of a jakes with him.—Spare my grey beard, you
:wagtail?

Corn.
:Peace, sirrah!
:You beastly knave, know you no reverence?

Kent.
:Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.

Corn.
:Why art thou angry?

Kent.
:That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
:Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
:Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
:Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
:That in the natures of their lords rebel;
:Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
:Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
:With every gale and vary of their masters,
:Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.—
:A plague upon your epileptic visage!
:Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
:Goose, an I had you upon Sarum plain,
:I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot.

Corn.
:What, art thou mad, old fellow?

Glou.
:How fell you out?
:Say that.

Kent.
:No contraries hold more antipathy
:Than I and such a knave.

Corn.
:Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?

Kent.
:His countenance likes me not.

Corn.
:No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.

Kent.
:Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
:I have seen better faces in my time
:Than stands on any shoulder that I see
:Before me at this instant.

Corn.
:This is some fellow
:Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect
:A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
:Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,—
:An honest mind and plain,—he must speak truth!
:An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
:These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
:Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
:Than twenty silly-ducking observants
:That stretch their duties nicely.

Kent.
:Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
:Under the allowance of your great aspect,
:Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
:On flickering Phoebus' front,—

Corn.
:What mean'st by this?

Kent.
:To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know,
:sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent
:was a plain knave; which, for my part, I will not be, though I
:should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.

Corn.
:What was the offence you gave him?

Osw.
:I never gave him any:
:It pleas'd the king his master very late
:To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
:When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,
:Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd
:And put upon him such a deal of man,
:That worthied him, got praises of the king
:For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;
:And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
:Drew on me here again.

Kent.
:None of these rogues and cowards
:But Ajax is their fool.

Corn.
:Fetch forth the stocks!—
:You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,
:We'll teach you,—

Kent.
:Sir, I am too old to learn:
:Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
:On whose employment I was sent to you:
:You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
:Against the grace and person of my master,
:Stocking his messenger.

Corn.
:Fetch forth the stocks!—As I have life and honour,
:there shall he sit till noon.

Reg.
:Till noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too!

Kent.
:Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
:You should not use me so.

Reg.
:Sir, being his knave, I will.

Corn.
:This is a fellow of the self-same colour
:Our sister speaks of.—Come, bring away the stocks!

[Stocks brought out.]

Glou.
:Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
:His fault is much, and the good king his master
:Will check him for't: your purpos'd low correction
:Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
:For pilferings and most common trespasses,
:Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill
:That he, so slightly valu'd in his messenger,
:Should have him thus restrain'd.

Corn.
:I'll answer that.

Reg.
:My sister may receive it much more worse,
:To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,
:For following her affairs.—Put in his legs.—

[Kent is put in the stocks.]

:Come, my good lord, away.

[Exeunt all but Gloucester and Kent.]

Glou.
:I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
:Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
:Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd; I'll entreat for thee.

Kent.
:Pray do not, sir: I have watch'd, and travell'd hard;
:Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
:A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
:Give you good morrow!

Glou.
:The duke's to blame in this: 'twill be ill taken.

[Exit.]

Kent.
:Good king, that must approve the common saw,—
:Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
:To the warm sun!
:Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
:That by thy comfortable beams I may
:Peruse this letter.—Nothing almost sees miracles
:But misery:—I know 'tis from Cordelia,
:Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
:Of my obscured course; and shall find time
:From this enormous state,—seeking to give
:Losses their remedies,—All weary and o'erwatch'd,
:Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
:This shameful lodging.
:Fortune, good night: smile once more, turn thy wheel!

[He sleeps.]

=== Scene III. The open Country. ===

[Enter Edgar.]

Edg.
:I heard myself proclaim'd;
:And by the happy hollow of a tree
:Escap'd the hunt. No port is free; no place
:That guard and most unusual vigilance
:Does not attend my taking. While I may scape,
:I will preserve myself: and am bethought
:To take the basest and most poorest shape
:That ever penury, in contempt of man,
:Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
:Blanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots;
:And with presented nakedness outface
:The winds and persecutions of the sky.
:The country gives me proof and precedent
:Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
:Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
:Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
:And with this horrible object, from low farms,
:Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
:Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
:Enforce their charity.—Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
:That's something yet:—Edgar I nothing am.

[Exit.]

=== Scene IV. Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks. ===

[Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.]

Lear.
:'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
:And not send back my messenger.

Gent.
:As I learn'd,
:The night before there was no purpose in them
:Of this remove.

Kent.
:Hail to thee, noble master!

Lear.
:Ha!
:Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?

Kent.
:No, my lord.

Fool.
:Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the
:head; dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and
:men by the legs: when a man is over-lusty at legs, then he
:wears wooden nether-stocks.

Lear.
:What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
:To set thee here?

Kent.
:It is both he and she,
:Your son and daughter.

Lear.
:No.

Kent.
:Yes.

Lear.
:No, I say.

Kent.
:I say, yea.

Lear.
:By Jupiter, I swear no.

Kent.
:By Juno, I swear ay.

Lear.
:They durst not do't.
:They would not, could not do't; 'tis worse than murder,
:To do upon respect such violent outrage:
:Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
:Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,
:Coming from us.

Kent.
:My lord, when at their home
:I did commend your highness' letters to them,
:Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
:My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
:Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
:From Goneril his mistress salutations;
:Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
:Which presently they read: on whose contents,
:They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
:Commanded me to follow and attend
:The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
:And meeting here the other messenger,
:Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine,—
:Being the very fellow which of late
:Display'd so saucily against your highness,—
:Having more man than wit about me, drew:
:He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
:Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
:The shame which here it suffers.

Fool.
:Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.
:  Fathers that wear rags
:    Do make their children blind;
:  But fathers that bear bags
:    Shall see their children kind.
:  Fortune, that arrant whore,
:  Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
:But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
:daughters as thou canst tell in a year.

Lear.
:O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
:Hysterica passio,—down, thou climbing sorrow,
:Thy element's below!—Where is this daughter?

Kent.
:With the earl, sir, here within.

Lear.
:Follow me not;
:Stay here.

[Exit.]

Gent.
:Made you no more offence but what you speak of?

Kent.
:None.
:How chance the king comes with so small a number?

Fool.
:An thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that question,
:thou hadst well deserved it.

Kent.
:Why, fool?

Fool.
:We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no
:labouring in the winter. All that follow their noses are led by
:their eyes but blind men; and there's not a nose among twenty
:but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great
:wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following
:it; but the great one that goes up the hill, let him draw thee
:after.
:When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
:would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
:   That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
:     And follows but for form,
:   Will pack when it begins to rain,
:     And leave thee in the storm.
:   But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
:     And let the wise man fly:
:   The knave turns fool that runs away;
:     The fool no knave, perdy.

Kent.
:Where learn'd you this, fool?

Fool.
:Not i' the stocks, fool.

[Re-enter Lear, with Gloucester.]

Lear.
:Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
:They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
:The images of revolt and flying off.
:Fetch me a better answer.

Glou.
:My dear lord,
:You know the fiery quality of the duke;
:How unremovable and fix'd he is
:In his own course.

Lear.
:Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!—
:Fiery? What quality? why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
:I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

Glou.
:Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.

Lear.
:Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?

Glou.
:Ay, my good lord.

Lear.
:The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
:Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
:Are they inform'd of this?—My breath and blood!—
:Fiery? the fiery duke?—Tell the hot duke that—
:No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
:Infirmity doth still neglect all office
:Whereto our health is bound: we are not ourselves
:When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
:To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
:And am fallen out with my more headier will,
:To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
:For the sound man.—Death on my state! Wherefore
:[Looking on Kent.]
:Should he sit here? This act persuades me
:That this remotion of the duke and her
:Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
:Go tell the duke and's wife I'd speak with them,
:Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
:Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
:Till it cry 'Sleep to death.'

Glou.
:I would have all well betwixt you.

[Exit.]

Lear.
:O me, my heart, my rising heart!—but down!

Fool.
:Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she
:put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em o' the coxcombs with
:a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that,
:in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.

[Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, and Servants.]

Lear.
:Good-morrow to you both.

Corn.
:Hail to your grace!

[Kent is set at liberty.]

Reg.
:I am glad to see your highness.

Lear.
:Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
:I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
:I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
:Sepulchring an adultress.—[To Kent] O, are you free?
:Some other time for that.—Beloved Regan,
:Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
:Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here,—
:[Points to his heart.]
:I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
:With how deprav'd a quality—O Regan!

Reg.
:I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope
:You less know how to value her desert
:Than she to scant her duty.

Lear.
:Say, how is that?

Reg.
:I cannot think my sister in the least
:Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
:She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
:'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
:As clears her from all blame.

Lear.
:My curses on her!

Reg.
:O, sir, you are old;
:Nature in you stands on the very verge
:Of her confine: you should be rul'd and led
:By some discretion, that discerns your state
:Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
:That to our sister you do make return;
:Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

Lear.
:Ask her forgiveness?
:Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
:'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
:[Kneeling.]
:Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
:That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'

Reg.
:Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks:
:Return you to my sister.

Lear.
:[Rising.] Never, Regan:
:She hath abated me of half my train;
:Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
:Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:—
:All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
:On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
:You taking airs, with lameness!

Corn.
:Fie, sir, fie!

Lear.
:You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
:Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
:You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
:To fall and blast her pride!

Reg.
:O the blest gods!
:So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.

Lear.
:No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
:Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
:Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
:Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
:To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
:To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
:And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
:Against my coming in: thou better know'st
:The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
:Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
:Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
:Wherein I thee endow'd.

Reg.
:Good sir, to the purpose.

Lear.
:Who put my man i' the stocks?

[Tucket within.]

Corn.
:What trumpet's that?

Reg.
:I know't—my sister's: this approves her letter,
:That she would soon be here.

[Enter Oswald.]

:Is your lady come?

Lear.
:This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride
:Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.—
:Out, varlet, from my sight!

Corn.
:What means your grace?

Lear.
:Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
:Thou didst not know on't.—Who comes here? O heavens!

[Enter Goneril.]

:If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
:Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
:Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!—
:[To Goneril.] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?—
:O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

Gon.
:Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
:All's not offence that indiscretion finds
:And dotage terms so.

Lear.
:O sides, you are too tough!
:Will you yet hold?—How came my man i' the stocks?

Corn.
:I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
:Deserv'd much less advancement.

Lear.
:You? did you?

Reg.
:I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
:If, till the expiration of your month,
:You will return and sojourn with my sister,
:Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
:I am now from home, and out of that provision
:Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

Lear.
:Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
:No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
:To wage against the enmity o' the air;
:To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,—
:Necessity's sharp pinch!—Return with her?
:Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
:Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
:To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
:To keep base life afoot.—Return with her?
:Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
:To this detested groom.
:[Pointing to Oswald.]

Gon.
:At your choice, sir.

Lear.
:I pr'ythee, daughter, do not make me mad:
:I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
:We'll no more meet, no more see one another:—
:But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
:Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
:Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
:A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle
:In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
:Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
:I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot
:Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
:Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
:I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
:I and my hundred knights.

Reg.
:Not altogether so:
:I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
:For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
:For those that mingle reason with your passion
:Must be content to think you old, and so—
:But she knows what she does.

Lear.
:Is this well spoken?

Reg.
:I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
:Is it not well? What should you need of more?
:Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
:Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house
:Should many people, under two commands,
:Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.

Gon.
:Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
:From those that she calls servants, or from mine?

Reg.
:Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack you,
:We could control them. If you will come to me,—
:For now I spy a danger,—I entreat you
:To bring but five-and-twenty: to no more
:Will I give place or notice.

Lear.
:I gave you all,—

Reg.
:And in good time you gave it.

Lear.
:Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
:But kept a reservation to be follow'd
:With such a number. What, must I come to you
:With five-and-twenty, Regan? said you so?

Reg.
:And speak't again my lord; no more with me.

Lear.
:Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
:When others are more wicked; not being the worst
:Stands in some rank of praise.—
:[To Goneril.] I'll go with thee:
:Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
:And thou art twice her love.

Gon.
:Hear, me, my lord:
:What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
:To follow in a house where twice so many
:Have a command to tend you?

Reg.
:What need one?

Lear.
:O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
:Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
:Allow not nature more than nature needs,
:Man's life is cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
:If only to go warm were gorgeous,
:Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
:Which scarcely keeps thee warm.—But, for true need,—
:You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
:You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
:As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
:If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
:Against their father, fool me not so much
:To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
:And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
:Stain my man's cheeks!—No, you unnatural hags,
:I will have such revenges on you both
:That all the world shall,—I will do such things,—
:What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be
:The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;
:No, I'll not weep:—
:I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
:Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
:Or ere I'll weep.—O fool, I shall go mad!

[Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm heard at a distance.]

Corn.
:Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.

Reg.
:This house is little: the old man and his people
:Cannot be well bestow'd.

Gon.
:'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
:And must needs taste his folly.

Reg.
:For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
:But not one follower.

Gon.
:So am I purpos'd.
:Where is my lord of Gloucester?

Corn.
:Followed the old man forth:—he is return'd.

[Re-enter Gloucester.]

Glou.
:The king is in high rage.

Corn.
:Whither is he going?

Glou.
:He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.

Corn.
:'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.

Gon.
:My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

Glou.
:Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds
:Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about
:There's scarce a bush.

Reg.
:O, sir, to wilful men
:The injuries that they themselves procure
:Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
:He is attended with a desperate train;
:And what they may incense him to, being apt
:To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.

Corn.
:Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
:My Regan counsels well: come out o' the storm.

[Exeunt.]
